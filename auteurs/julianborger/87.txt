The Senate report on the CIAâs detention and interrogation program represents the most authoritative and comprehensive finding since the US launched its so-called âwar on terrorâ more than 13 years ago that torture does not work.
That conclusion will be contested, most of all by former members of the Bush administration and CIA officials involved in the program. They have launched a public relations backlash to the finding, with its own dedicated website. But the sheer bulk and depth of the Senate intelligence committee report will make it much harder to win that argument.
The report finds that CIA detainees subjected to what were then called âenhanced interrogation techniquesâ either produced no intelligence, or they âfabricated information, resulting in faulty intelligenceâ. It says that the CIAâs own interrogators âassessed that the most effective method for acquiring intelligence from detainees, including from detainees the âThis is an authoritative conclusion,â said Philippe Sands, a law professor at University College, London and the author of In particular, the Senate delivers a verdict on the debate over whether the torture of two senior al-Qaida figures, Abu Zubaydah and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, forced them to divulge intelligence that prevented further terrorist attacks and thereby saved lives. They were subjected to waterboarding, the pouring of water over a cloth draped over the face to simulate drowning, 83 times in Abu Zubaydahâs case and 183 times in Khalid Sheikh Mohammedâs. 
Defenders of waterboarding, which was declared to be torture by the Obama administration, claimed it led to concrete results. They said that its use on Abu Zubaydah led to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, and that the latterâs interrogation using waterboarding led to the location and killing of Osama bin Laden. Former vice-president Dick Cheney claimed that the techniques produced âphenomenalâ results. 
The Senate report refutes those claims.
They had already been denied by former interrogators at the heart of the post-9/11 manhunt. In 2009, a former FBI agent, Ali Soufan, who had taken part in the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah seven years earlier, said that all the useful intelligence came from traditional non-violent questioning, and that his later waterboarding produced nothing further of value.
âAlmost all the agency officials I worked with on these issues were good people who felt as I did about the use of enhanced techniques: it is un-American, ineffective and harmful to our national security,â Soufan wrote.
A former official from the US navyâs criminal investigative service, Mark Fallon, wrote on Monday: âAs special agent in charge of the criminal investigation task force with investigators and intelligence personnel at Guantánamo Bay, Afghanistan, and Iraq, I was privy to the information provided by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. I was aware of no valuable information that came from waterboarding.â
The failure of the US military to corner Bin Laden at Tora Bora in Afghanistan at the end of 2001, and the al-Qaida leaderâs subsequent escape into Pakistan, led to a growing sense of urgency within the Bush administration.
The then head of CIA counter-terrorism, Cofer Black, said: âAfter 9/11, the gloves came off.â As the then defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, put pressure on the officers running the new Guantánamo Bay detention camp to come up with fast actionable intelligence, traditional investigators like Soufan and Fallon were shouldered aside and ignored. The use of the âenhanced techniquesâ spread. As another former navy interrogator, Mike Gelles put it in Torture Team: âThe problem is, once you take the dogs off the leash, you cannot put them back on.â
