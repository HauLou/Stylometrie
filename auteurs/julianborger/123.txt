This week is UNGA week, short for Each head of state or government will have 15 minutes to say what is on his or her mind at the assemblyâs famous green marble podium. It is a restriction often abused, though seldom as much as by Muammar Gaddafi in 2009 when he spoke for more than 90 minutes.
This year the general assembly will take place in a chamber newly renovated at the end of a seven-year overhaul. The gold-leaf backdrop behind the UN insignia has been replaced at huge expense â the original had become caked in nicotine from decades of cigarette and cigar smoke. Smoking is now prohibited in the chamber and the ashtrays have been removed from the delegatesâ desks, one of the first changes to the 1940s design.
Another UN tradition is for leaders of countries with strained bilateral relations to have carefully orchestrated âchance encountersâ in the corridors around the chamber. Last year there was great anticipation of such a meeting between Barack Obama and Iranâs newly elected president, Hassan Rouhani. In the end, their contact was limited to a last-minute mobile phone conversation while Rouhani was on the way to the airport for his flight home.
This year an encounter between the pair is even less likely as nuclear talks between Iran and the major powers, due to continue on the sidelines of the general assembly, have hit a rough patch.
Here are some of the expected highlights of the week (all times are New York time):
on stopping nuclear proliferation) and only the sixth time the council has met at head of state or head of government level.
