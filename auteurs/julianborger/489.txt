In the past few days, at a time of high tension in the Gulf, Iranannounced that it had produced and tested its first fuel rod at the Tehran Research Reactor. It also claimed to have mastered theproduction of nuclear plates. 
My understanding is that what is being tested at the TRR is a rod designed to be used at the heavy water reactor under construction in Arak. Making assemblies of plates of the kind required to fuel the TRR itself is still some way off.
It appears from the announcement that what Iran has produced andIR-40 heavy water reactor at Arak, rather than for a light water nuclear power station like Bushehr, which uses rods of low enriched U-235.
This is a cause for concern as such an action is proscribed by theSome of the Iranian news articles claim it is easy to manufacture a fuel plate after making a fuel rod. However, manufacturing processes for rods and plates are very different, each with its own challenges, and making a plate using homogeneous 20 % enriched uranium will not be straightforward. Iran has yet to demonstrate it can do this.
If everything proceeds as planned, the first real fuel assemblies can be introduced to the reactor some time next year. That is when current stocks of TRR fuel are due to run out.
The fact that Iran is still a year away from actual production of theIran's current stock of 20 % enriched uranium should be sufficient toHere's a thought: The P5+1 could provide modern, safe and secure nuclear technology, fuel for the TRR and in the longer term, a more efficient research reactor. Iran could in turn relinquish its stock of enriched uranium.
Iran and the P5+1 should also convert Iran's IR-40 heavy water reactor
