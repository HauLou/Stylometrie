In the Balkans, more than anywhere else, football is the continuation of war by other means. There is a long history of violence underlying the chaos in the Belgrade stadium â this is just the first time it has taken the very 21st-century form of a drone conflict.
Every scene on Tuesday night was freighted with centuries-old grudges and rivalries that last erupted into armed conflict in the 1998-9 war between The map suspended from the drone showed a map of a âGreater Albaniaâ including Kosovo and parts of Macedonia. On either side were portraits of two heroes from Albaniaâs war of independence against the Ottoman Empire. The country that the Albanians thought they were going to get after the collapse of the Ottomans was cut in half at an international conference in London in 1912-13, and the Albanians have never forgotten.

Ivanovic said after the game: âWhatâs most important to us is that we stood by the Albanian representation as a team and supported them. We regret that football was presented as a secondary issue here.â
