The trial of former Bosnian Serb military commander Mladic's defence said the prosecution had failed to hand over 1m pages of evidence and said it would need six months to go through all the material. In a submission to the court, the prosecution said that only 3% of the total number of documents in the case were affected, and that many of them were duplicates or English translations of other documents already in the hands of the Mladic legal team.
The judges on Thursday rejected the request for a six-month halt, saying a shorter postponement of the original 29 May date to hear the first witness was more reasonable.
The prosecution argued that "the error is technical in nature and has a limited impact on the Mladic defence's ability to prepare for the commencement of the evidence presentation". It said the error was made by a technician running a database of 100,000 documents, who set up an inventory that did not correspond with the actual contents of the database.
The prosecution team relied on the inventory when handing documents such as witness statements to the defence, and only discovered the error days before the trial began on 16 May.
Mladic is charged with orchestrating the siege of Sarajevo from 1992 to 1995 and the execution of up to 8,000 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica in July 1995, among other crimes against humanity while commanding Bosnian Serb forces. He denies the charges, and lawyers have predicted that the trial could last several years.
