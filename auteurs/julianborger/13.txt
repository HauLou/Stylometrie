When Selahattin DemirtaÅ shrugged off the formal traditions of Turkish political campaigning and went on a television talk show equipped with a The co-leader of the Peoplesâ Democratic party (HDP), sniffed the Turkish president, was a mere âpop starâ. But, far from hurting DemirtaÅ, the remark merely served to highlight ErdoÄanâs fear of the 42-year-oldâs youthful, telegenic appeal and sense of humour.
His musical performance was just one of the ways in which DemirtaÅ â the man who has done more than anyone to thwart ErdoÄanâs aspirations to build an all-powerful presidency â achieved electoral breakthrough by thumbing his nose at political convention.

Although his brother Nurettin joined the insurgent nationalist PKK party, and was jailed for his membership, DemirtaÅ remained a moderate. When history repeated itself and an HDP rally was bombed in Diyarbakir last month, DemirtaÅ appealed to his followers for calm.
He studied law at Ankara University and began his career as a human rights activist, becoming a founding member of the Turkish Human Rights Association.
