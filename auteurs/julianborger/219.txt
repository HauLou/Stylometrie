Not for the first time in the past seven decades, the US is wondering just how much benefit it gains from playing host to the New Yorkers have become accustomed to the annual inconvenience, though that does not stop the grumbling on local radio. More seriously, however, for America's self-image and standing in the world, the famous green marble podium in the general assembly hall, once again provided a launching pad for a tirade against US power.
This time the broadside was launched by She followed in a long line of foreign leaders who have come to Manhattan to exploit the UN's location to deliver harsh messages at the heart of US economic and cultural might. Nikita Khrushchev famously banged his shoe on the lectern and pledged: "We will bury you." In 2006, it was Hugo Ch√°vez's turn. The Venezuelan leader took to the lectern a day after George W Bush and declared: "The devil came here yesterday, and it smells of sulphur still today."
What made Rousseff's speech even more painful to Washington's ears was that it came from a supposed American ally in a strategically vital part of the world, and was delivered while President Obama was waiting in the wings to speak. The buzz left in the chamber by the Brazilian's fulminations distracted attention from the opening lines of Obama's message.

By comparison, Rouhani cannot help but soothe.
He has arrived in town with a lighter footprint. In 2012, Ahmadinejad caused outrage back in his impoverished and embattled homeland by taking nearly 140 people with him. It became a scandal and the subject of a parliamentary debate.
Anxious to emphasise the differences from his predecessor, Rouhani appears to have taken a relatively modest number of people with him, perhaps half the size of Ahmadinejad. The entourage includes an Iranian Jewish MP, Siamak Moreh Sedgh, another sharply drawn distinction from Ahmadinejad's rants.
As Rouhani flew into The first opportunity for a meeting came at Tuesday's official lunch, at which Obama was sitting alongside the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. But Rouhani did not sit down for tuna tartar and veal ossobuco with his fellow leaders, perhaps preferring to keep the global focus on what he had to say.
The UN general assembly has many detractors, who point to the millions of dollars spent on indulging the vanity of the planet's leaders and their tendency to declaim at much length. But, sometimes, like this year, it serves as a reminder that the world needs somewhere to meet, and when they have something new to say to each other, it can make for powerful drama.
