The global civilian death toll from explosive weapons has increased dramatically in recent years, driven in part by the greater use of aerial bombs on populated areas, often by governments including Syria and Although the international community has taken concerted action to curb the use of chemical weapons, the report by advocacy group Action on Armed Violence (AOAV) confirms that conventional explosives, can be just as devastating and indiscriminate when used against towns and cities. 
AOAVâs report, Explosive States, which examines data for 2014, found that when explosive weapons were used in urban areas, 92% of the casualties were civilians, compared with 34% in rural areas. In 2014, there were 32,662 civilian casualties from weapons including aerial bombs, mortars and car bombs, an increase of 5% on 2013, and 52% higher than 2011, when AOAV started collecting data. 
Monthly casualties

âThis is the third consecutive year that we have seen an increase in civilian deaths and injuries from explosive weapons,âMore than half the civilian casualties in 2014 were caused by improvised explosive devices (IEDs) such as car bombs and suicide vests. The prevalence of such weapons in Iraq has helped make it the most dangerous place in the world for civilians, in terms of explosive weapons, with more than 10,000 casualties for the second year running. Deaths by IED increased dramatically in Nigeria over the course of 2014, as Civilian casualties by weapon type

The most striking and lethal development in 2014 was the increased use of aerial bombs by governments on densely populated areas. The number of civilian casualties from such weapons almost trebled from the previous year. The overwhelming majority of the casualties by aerial bombardment were caused by Syria (46% of the total) and Israel (35%).
In Syria, government forces made dramatically increased use of barrel bombs â containers filled with fuel, explosives and chunks of jagged metal typically pushed out of helicopters by hand, killing people and destroying buildings over a wide areas. In 2013, barrel bombs accounted for 20% of aerial attacks. In 2014, that proportion had doubled. The bulk of barrel bomb attacks (85%) were on urban areas.

 âOur data shows that states were far more willing to carry out aerial bombings in populated areas, bucking a recent trend. Itâs a deeply worrying development,â Overton said. âItâs almost no surprise to see Israel was the state force behind the most civilian casualties from explosive weapons. The weapons used in Gaza last year included thousands of unguided artillery shells, as well as massive aircraft bombs, which, even if guided to a target, can still impact a wide area. AOAVâs research suggests, that for artillery at least, Israel had relaxed the rules, making it easier for troops to use these weapons in or near populated areas. You simply canât do that on such a large scale without increasing risk of death, injury and damage to civilians and civilian areas.â
