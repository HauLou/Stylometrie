Last week, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, Mohamed Ali Alhakim, caused a stir with a letter announcing that terrorist groups had seized nearly 40 kilograms of 'uranium compounds' from Mosul University. 
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) moved quickly to reassure the publc that the material was 'low-grade' and did not represent a security or safety risk. But the IAEA did not specify what the missing materials were, or whether it knew about them before they disappeared. 
Lots of universities have uranium compounds for chemistry and physics research and teaching. Some Iraqi universities had uranyl acetate, which is used in electron microscopy and chemical analysis. In the 1980's, such uranium laboratory reagent chemicals could be bought from commercial suppliers. But typically a lab would have a few kilograms of such reagents, not 40 kg - a substantial amount.
The university has an active physics faculty, but one of its leading lights, Dr Faika Azooz, wrote to say all they had there were one microcurie radiation sources which "can hardly give enough radioactivity to [test] characteristic properties of geiger and Nal [radiation] counters". But Azooz added: "I've no idea if there are some nuclear wastes from old IAEA [inspections?] thrown in other places." 
A former IAEA inspector who worked extensively in In the late 1980's Iraq operated a secret facility (the Al Jesira conversion plant) about 30 miles west of Mosul for the production of uranium dioxide (UO2) and uranium tetrachloride (UCl4)...This sounds like a convincing explanation. The questions that remain for the IAEA whether it knew about about this residual stockpile or not. Even if it was 'low-grade' it should have been removed.
