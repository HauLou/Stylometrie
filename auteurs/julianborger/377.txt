Dawoud Rajha, who has been killed in a bomb attack in Damascus, had the top job in the Syrian defence ministry but that did not mean he was the most powerful security official. His identity as a Christian helped the regime present an image of multi-ethnicity.
As is the case in many ministries, there was an Alawite, President Bashar al-Assad's brother-in-law Assef Shawkat, in the number two position at defence, and his membership of the family network was far more important than title.
Furthermore, the defence ministry is less powerful than the interior ministry, intelligence service and Maher al-Assad's Republican Guard. But Rajha's presence around the table at the national security council reflected the fact that he wielded real clout in the apparatus.
