An international panel of retired judges has called for a new inquiry into the death in 1961 of the It says that significant new evidence has emerged and that the possibility that Hammarskjöld's plane was shot down should be taken seriously.
The Hammarskjöld commission â chaired by a former British privy council judge, Sir Stephen Sedley, and including the former chief prosecutor at the Hague war crimes tribunal, Sir Richard Goldstone â also appealed to the US to declassify reported National Security Agency (NSA) radio intercepts of warplanes over the area, which are still categorised as top secret, 52 years after Hammarskjöld's death.
The commission pointed to several strands of evidence supporting a theory that Hammarskjöld's DC6 airplane was shot down on the night of 17 September 1961, while he was on a mission to Ndola, in what was then Northern Rhodesia, to try to negotiate a ceasefire between the Congolese government and rebels from the mineral-rich Katanga region, who had significant support from Belgian mercenaries.
The report highlighted five key pieces of evidence:
The commission said it had already requested "It is a near certainty not only that Ndola's radio traffic was being monitored routinely by the NSA from Cyprus or elsewhere, but that one or both of the large Usaf aircraft which had been flown in to Ndola on the crucial night and were parked throughout on the tarmac were there for the specific purpose of monitoring the local radio traffic," it added.
A covering letter by Sedley accompanying the commission's report said: "Our answer to the question posed to us â whether the UN would be justified in reopening its own inquiry in the light of the evidence now available â is a qualified but firm yes."
He said that a "dependable answer" to the Albertina mystery is within reach, but that such an answer "will probably not be comprehensive".
It is not clear whether the UN will heed the commission's advice to open a new inquiry. There have already been three investigations, two of which were inconclusive, and one that pointed to pilot error.
A Guardian investigation in August 2011 pointed to the evidence that the Albertina was shot down, and that was followed later in the same year by a book, Who Killed Hammarskjöld?, by British academic, Susan Williams, who argued that there was substantial evidence that hardline Belgian colonialists, outraged at UN support for the Congolese government in Kinshasa, were behind the death of the veteran Swedish dilpomat, which was then covered up by the British colonial authorities.
