The Arab League is to host a meeting of the Syrian opposition in Cairo on Saturday in an effort to produce a common programme to unite opponents of President Bashar al-Assad's regime, but the effort has been marred by disunity and a threatened boycott by the Syrian National Council (SNC).
Internal groups and members of the diaspora were invited to nominate delegates to the committee to draft a transition plan for a post-Assad "The meeting is going to go ahead with or without them. It's time for them to wake up and smell the coffee," said a European diplomat, who believes the SNC is reluctant to see its prestige diluted to just one voice on a 21-strong opposition committee.
Over recent months, the UK and the US have abandoned their initial policy of encouraging regime opponents to coalesce around the SNC because of the dominant role of the Muslim Brotherhood in the council and its apparent failure to forge ties with rebel groups inside Syria.
The UK announced earlier this month it would channel Â£5m in new non-military aid to internal opposition groups rather than the SNC.
France has continued to lend support to the SNC and its officials said they were still trying to persuade the group to take part in the Cairo talks.
Meanwhile, Paris played down reported remarks by the defence minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, which appeared to reflect backing for some form of no-fly zone over part of Syria. Officials said he had been misquoted and any foreign air activity over Syria would be illegal.
