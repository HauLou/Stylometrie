Centred on the southern Paris suburbs, including the Montrouge area where a police officer was killed in the attacks, the French arrests were made in connection with suspected âlogistical supportâ for the shootings, an official said.

Kerry was in Paris on Friday to meet French leaders and deliver a speech at Paris city hall in a visit aimed at making up for the absence of senior US officials at Sundayâs mass rally in defiance of the terrorist attacks.
At an early-morning meeting at the foreign ministry with his French counterpart, Laurent Fabius, Kerry explained he had been unable to come on Sunday because of a previously arranged trip to India.
âItâs good to be with you,â Kerry told Fabius. âWe have a lot to talk about.â Over the course of the day he was also due to meet President François Hollande and the Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo.
Kerry had said the hastily arranged trip was to âshare a big hug for Parisâ in the wake of the terror attacks, but he landed in the French capital on Thursday night as the violence spread north to Belgium. A visit that was intended to be commemorative and symbolic appeared likely to become urgent and operational as European and US officials seek to contain the spread of jihadist attacks in the west.

Sundayâs mass rally was attended by leaders from around âIt was not really issue in France until it became a row in America. No one drew attention to the absence of a senior American,â said Bruno Tertrais, a senior research fellow at the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris. âMaybe Obama should be more worried about that â that nobody noticed.â
