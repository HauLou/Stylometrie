The Iranian president, Rouhani told the UN general assembly on Thursday that regional powers should lead the battle against Isis in Syria and Iraq. Western policies in the region had led to the rise of violent extremism in the first place, he said, and if outsiders wanted to help fight extremism now, they should support the Iranian leadership.
Negotiations aimed at reaching a breakthrough agreement between Iran and six major powers have been continuing on the margins of the general assembly.

He added that if âwe fail to entrust the job to the people in the region who can do the job, tomorrow the world will be safe for no one.â
