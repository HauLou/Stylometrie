The spread of the Islamic State's dominance across the map of the The relentless advance of the The group now controls a swath of territory that has spread to the Lebanese border in the west and Irbil in the east, where it routed the Kurdish peshmerga forces, thought until last week to be the most cohesive in The Isis offensive has been shocking not just in its speed. The movement's barbarity goes beyond even the worst excesses of the Syrian war. It has made the videoed mass execution its trademark, revelling in bloodlust. It announced its offensive into Iraq in June with declarations it had summarily killed nearly 2,000 Shia soldiers from the national army in Tikrit. When its black-flagged forces finally overran a long-beleaguered Syrian military base at Raqqa last week, captured soldiers were beheaded and their heads impaled on metal fences in the town centre.
The prodigious Isis media operation has posted gruesome videos on the web purporting to show mass killings of men from the ancient Yazidi faith in Sinjar. The terror sent some 40,000 Yaszidis fleeing the Sinjar mountains near Mosul risking starvation or death by thirst, forcing the US forces back to Iraq with overnight humanitarian air drops and air strikes against Isis artillery.
Isis fighters now claim to control the Mosul dam, giving them even more destructive potential, though the claim has been disputed. If they did succeed in blowing it up, it would send a wave 65 ft high rolling into Mosul city, engulfing its 1.5 million people.
"We must neutralise this enemy," US army lieutenant general Mick Bednarek, the head of the 750-strong residual US military presence, told the Army Times. "This is a common enemy issue that we've got to address."
The group "is not just a violent extremist organisation," Bednarek said. "This is an army, and it takes an army to defeat an army."
The question is, whose army? The Iraqi national army, riven by sectarian divisions and weak leadership, turned and fled in June. The Kurdish peshmerga had proved effective in small groups with US special forces support, but was no match for an integrated, confident and highly mobile force with plenty of artillery support. Their best hope for holding on in Irbil is US air strikes targeted by American special forces in the town, but that will not push Isis back across the map of the Middle East.
Over the border in Syria, the Assad regime largely left Isis alone for years, so it could grow at the expense of their common enemy, the moderate Syrian opposition. Since June, the Assad regime has started bombing Isis positions in Iraq, but to a degree sufficient to underline its longstanding message that it is indispensable to the west in a global battle against Sunni extremism.
"The government imposed a media ban to prevent this catastrophe from turning into a severe criticism of their behaviour," said Sinan Ulgen, a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe. "But the hostage situation affects Ankara's approach to Isis. So much so that Ankara said a couple of weeks ago they were opposed to air strikes."
Although the joint US-Turkish air base at Incirlik appears to have been used in the delivery of humanitarian relief, the US has launched air strikes from the USS George HW Bush carrier in the Gulf, possibly out of consideration of Turkey's hostage situation.Emile Hokayem, of the International Institute of Strategic Studies, argued that one of the dilemmas of the current situation is the tactical goal of relieving the threat to the Yazidis and Irbil may conflict with the long-term objective of rolling back the Isis advance.
"The risk now is that without a political strategy, a limited strike, will validate Isis propaganda and mobilize its audience (including disenfranchised Sunnis in Iraq and beyond)," Hokayem said.
Most observers believe that the struggle with Isis can only be won once the political vacuum among the Sunni communities in Syria and Iraq is addressed. In Syria, that might mean gradually strengthening the moderate Sunni opposition, which the US has hitherto kept on a tight leash. In June Washington agreed to sent it another $500m.
In Iraq, many believe Isis will only be defeated after the departure of Nuri al-Maliki, whose narrowly pro-Shia approach to government and his persecution of Iraqi Sunnis they blame for the depth of the current crisis.
"US military strikes and assistance will certainly help push back against Isis but if local Sunnis are not on board it won't be enough to defeat them â and could actually make the situation worse if viewed as US complicity with the Maliki and Assad regimes against them," argued Julien Barnes-Dacey, of the European Council for Foreign Relations. "In the Iraq context this will probably only come about on the back of a new governing pact that offers aggrieved Sunnis a real stake in the system. Isis are ideologically committed, battle-hardened and well-equipped, and now pose a far deeper challenge than that posed by al-Qaida in Iraq during the US occupation. What is clear is that this will be a very long and difficult fight."
