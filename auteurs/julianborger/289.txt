Nuclear negotiations between major world powers and The European Union, co-ordinator for the six powers involved in the discussions â the US, UK, France, Germany, China and Russia â confirmed it had proposed talks on 25 February in the former Soviet republic but was waiting to hear back from the Iranian negotiators.
Nuclear talks are led by a foreign policy adviser to Iran's supreme leader, not by the foreign ministry.
"We have proposed concrete dates and venue ever since early December," said Michael Mann, an EU spokesman. "Our latest proposal had indeed been Kazakhstan in the week of 25 February after other proposals had not worked. So it is good to hear that the foreign minister finally confirmed now. We hope the negotiating team will also confirm."
Salehi announced the talks at a Munich security conference where both he and the US vice-president, Joe Biden, said their governments would eventually be open to bilateral talks. However, both laid down vague conditions.
On Saturday, Biden said the two countries could talk as long as Iran was serious about negotiations. "We're not prepared to do it just for the exercise," he said.
Speaking on Sunday, Salehi responded by saying Iran had "no red lines" when it came to bilateral negotiations, but added Tehran would have to be sure the US had "fair and real intentions" to improve the relationship between the two countries, which have not had diplomatic ties since Iranian revolutionaries took US diplomats hostage in 1979. The two sides would have to go into talks "on an equal footing", Salehi added, calling for a change in US rhetoric.
The last round of nuclear talks between Iran and the six powers ended without agreement in Moscow in June. The six nations called for Iran to end production of medium-enriched uranium in return for help with civil nuclear energy development and lifting a ban on buying aircraft parts.
The west was criticised afterwards by some analysts for not putting major sanctions relief on the table. Vali Nasr, a former state department adviser and now dean of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, Washington, said: "It will not be useful to go back with the same offer. There now has to be a serious conversation between the US and the Europeans to get their ducks in a row. They have to be clear on what the Iranians will get in return for doing X, Y or Z."
