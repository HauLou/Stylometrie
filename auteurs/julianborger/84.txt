The United Nationsâ general assembly is set to approve a fresh inquiry into the death of the organisationâs secretary-general, Dag Hammarskjöld, in a 1961 air crash.
Sweden will present a resolution to the assembly on Monday calling for the creation of an independent panel of experts to look at one of the great political mysteries of the 60s: why a plane carrying one of its most famous diplomats came down over what is now Zambia, but was then the British colony of Northern Rhodesia.
The resolution cites the emergence of new evidence and calls for the UN panel to examine it âand to assess its probative valueâ. It also appeals to governments to release documents about the Hammarskjöld crash that have remained secret until now. The resolution has 20 co-sponsors from around the world and is expected to win overwhelming support.
âI would expect a consensus decision to be taken, so it would be passed by acclamation,â Annika Söder, the state secretary in the Swedish foreign ministry, said. âI canât see anyone being against steps for getting clarification.â
Söder said there could a delay of in earmarking the necessary funds for a panel of experts â initially about $300,000 (£240,000) â but that should only take a further week. Once established, the panel could request crucial documents about the crash from the US National Security Agency and the CIA, as well as still-classified records held by the UK and other western European states.
The plane in which Hammarskjöld and his staff were travelling crashed near the town of Ndola, while the UN secretary-general was trying to broker a peace deal between the Congolese government in Kinshasa and separatists in the mineral-rich southern province of Katanga backed by mining corporations and mercenaries.
A 1962 report by the British colonial authorities in Rhodesia blamed the crash on pilot error but offered no proof. A UN inquiry returned an open verdict. Since then new evidence has come to light, including the testimony of local people that was downplayed or ignored in the original report.
The new material was published in a 2011 book, Who Killed Hammarskjöld? The UN, the Cold War and White Supremacy in Africa, by a British academic, Susan Williams, who argued that Hammarskjöld was shot down by mercenaries fighting for Katanga. The Guardian also published a report the same year, based in part on the research of a Swedish diplomat, Göran Björkdahl, which cast doubt the official version of events, and pointed to the possibility a second plane had been close to the UN aircraft.
Williams welcomed Mondayâs vote, saying: âThere is no better way to reassess the history of colonisation and the cold war than through the leadership of the Last year, a commission of international legal experts, including Richard Goldstone, the former chief prosecutor at The Hagueâs war crimes tribunal, called for the case to be reopened and appealed to the US and other governments to declassify secret documents on the crash. In particular, it presented a formal request for the declassification of NSA and CIA intercepts from the night of the crash on 17-18 September 1961, but without success.
âWe know they must have listened to the radio traffic that night and transcribed it,â Hans Corell, a Swedish judge and former diplomat who was a member of the Hammarskjold commission, told the Guardian. âThe NSA had station in Cyprus, where they were listening to high-frequency transmission.
âWe also know the CIA had two Dakota planes on the tarmac in Ndola that night with their engines running. Why would a plane have its engine running in the middle of the night? To run the generators, for the interception equipment.â
The commission was told there were classified US intelligence documents relevant to its inquiry, but they were not released. Its members hope that a panel requesting the information in the name of the UN will have better luck.
In March 2014, the UN secretary general, Ban ki-Moon, issued a statement saying: âAdditional new evidence may exist which, for national security reasons, was and remains classified by several governments more than 50 years after the fact.
âI trust that the general assembly may wish to encourage member states, in the light of the passage of time, to seek to declassify any relevant records in their possession in accordance with their respective national legislation.â
Söder said: âEarlier investigations were not at all certain in their judgment. We hope for full clarity. Dag Hammarskjöld was an important statesman, one of several political personalities who have died in unclear circumstances.
âBut there are also the families of the other people on the plane. The family of the Swedish pilot for example. The official inquiry blamed pilot error. But what if that was wrong? It would be good if it was either confirmed or proven wrong.â
