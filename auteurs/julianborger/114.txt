The new head of The appointment represents continuity in policy and strategy, as Younger has served as the right-hand man to Sir John Sawers, the outgoing head of MI6, officially known as the Secret Intelligence Service. Sawers steps down next month.
âIâm delighted that my colleague and friend is taking over from me. He has played a vital part alongside me in modernising SIS and ensuring that the service is in the best possible shape to play our part in defending the countryâs security and our values,â Sawers said in a statement.
Younger has been an intelligence officer since the end of the Cold War in 1991, after studying economics and serving as a British army officer. He held a variety of postings in Europe and the Middle East before becoming the senior SIS officer in Afghanistan. His official biography says he enjoys music, sailing and mountaineering.
âAlex brings a wealth of relevant experience including his work in Afghanistan and helping keep the country safe during the London 2012 Olympics,â foreign secretary Philip Hammond said on announcing the appointment.
Younger said: âOur dedicated staff work tirelessly against an array of threats that this country faces. They do so in close partnership with both MI5 and A Foreign Office source said that the appointment represented âcontinuity of modernisationâ. Over the past two decades, MI6 has had to adapt to new national security threats from Islamic extremism, cyber attacks and nuclear proliferation, while coping with a return to Cold War-levels of mistrust in relations with Moscow.
The need for reform and modernisation was underlined by the intelligence debacle over Saddam Husseinâs supposed weapons of mass destruction, and the July 2005 suicide attacks on London transport. During Sawersâ five years in office, there were no major terrorist attacks on the UK mainland.
