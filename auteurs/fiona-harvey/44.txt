A row has broken out within the wind power industry over the future of small wind farm installations in the UK, and the subsidies that should be paid to them.According to a report from the IPPR thinktank, widely reported in the media (in the FT, Times, Mail and Channel 4 News), about 100 wind turbines are receiving an unfair level of subsidy by exploiting a provision in the subsidy regime. The thinktank has estimated that each of the turbines in question could be receiving £100,000 a year in âexcessâ subsidies as a result, amounting to about £10m.
But the government, the regulator Ofgem and the wind industry have rejected the claims. A spokeswoman for the Department of The IPPR report was co-authored by Charles Ogilvie, a former adviser to ex-energy minister Greg Barker and currently an associate at Bellenden, a PR company. Bellendenâs clients include Vergnet, a manufacturer of small wind turbines that is mentioned in the report, and which could stand to benefit from less competition in its core market if the government implements IPPRâs advice to ban larger models from the higher rate of feed-in tariffs.
IPPR, which did not pay Ogilvie for his work, told the Guardian there was no conflict of interest. Prefacing the report, IPPR listed Ogilvieâs position at Bellenden but did not mention its clients. A spokesman for the thinktank said: âIPPR has no conflict of interest and we have been completely transparent about the authors and who they work for. No-one has been able to find any inaccuracy with the report and we stand by our findings.â
According to the report, 103 of the UKâs 217 wind turbines with capacity of up to 500kW for which feed-in tariffs are paid have been altered to make them run at a lower capacity than they are capable of â a process known as âde-ratingâ â in order to qualify for higher subsidy payments. As a result, according to IPPR, larger wind turbines than are needed are increasingly being bought by developers, and the market for smaller wind turbines is threatened.
Turbines with a capacity of more than 500KW receive the lower rate feed-in tariff, paid at 7.24p per kilowatt hour of electricity generated. Turbines with a capacity of 500KW or less receive the feed-in tariff, worth 13.34p per kilowatt hour.
The manufacturer of the vast majority of the 100 turbines identified by IPPR is EWT, which denies it has de-rated machines, telling the Guardian that its 500KW turbines have been designed and manufactured as such.
The IPPR study quoted a headline figure for the âexcessâ subsidy as a cost of £400m to energy bill payers though none of the media reports mentioned Ogilvieâs connection to Vergnet. This headline figure was arrived at by estimating that the number of 500kw turbines the IPPR identifies as derated would continue to grow at the current pace and assuming that they will be paid the full subsidy for the next 20 years, though this is not guaranteed.
Ofgem, the energy regulator, told the Guardian that none of the wind farms had received more money than they were entitled to: the feed-in tariffs are paid based on the metered units of power generated. Neither have consumers paid out more in subsidy as a result of the system, because the amount of subsidy added to bills is capped by the government. The main losers from the current subsidy system are makers of small turbines, such as Vergnet, whose turbine is illustrated on page 6 of the report. Vergnet does not sell 500kW turbines, producing only smaller models of up to 275kW and a larger one of 1MW which would not qualify for the scheme.The IPPR report devotes nearly a page to the plight of such makers of small turbines: âThe design flaw [in the subsidy system] is also putting a squeeze on to those companies that are making the smaller turbines, which these subsidies are intended to encourage. This squeeze on the manufacturers of smaller turbines could lead to job losses, or incentivise them to join with their competitors who are already exploiting the loophole.â The solution, the thinktank argues, is to ban turbines with blades over a certain size from receiving their current higher rate of feed-in tariff, even though this could impair efficiency.
The IPPR analysis did not report on many of the reasons why wind farm owners choose larger turbines. In cases where profit margins are thin, turbines may only be economically viable if they receive the higher rate of subsidy. At the lower rate, they would not be built, depriving the UK of wind power. Some larger turbines are also used for legitimate engineering reasons, said Renewable UK, trade body for the industry, such asAnother big reason, which IPPR acknowledges, is that larger turbines are more efficient when the wind is not blowing strongly, meaning they can still generate power when smaller ones would be becalmed.
Ofgem, the energy regulator, said it did not regard the difference in payments under the feed-in tariff and the renewable obligation as a âloopholeâ, as IPPR alleged. An Ofgem official told the Guardian: âWhat matters is the amount of electricity generated. We do not think this is exploiting the system. It is very clear how much each wind farm has been paid for the power it produces.â
Maf Smith, deputy chief executive of Renewable UK, said: âThe wind industry adheres strictly to the legally-binding guidelines drawn up by Ofgem and Decc on how turbines operate. Itâs also worth remembering that weâre talking here about 103 operational turbines at most. Thatâs less than 1% of the 12,000 small, medium and large onshore wind turbines generating in the UK.â
Most of the 103 turbines identified by IPPR are models produced by the turbine manufacturer EWT, and known as DW 52/54. A spokesman for EWT told the Guardian that these machines were designed, built and certified as 500kW turbines. âThey have been inspected and they are 500kW - they are not capable of any more,â he said. Some components are similar to those in 900kW models but many, including the drive train, are âcompletely differentâ.
On page 6 of its report, IPPR has a diagram showing the alleged height of smaller and larger wind turbines. However, all but one of the smaller wind turbines listed as being 30m in height â including one by Vergnet â are capable of only about half the power output of a 500kW turbine, so if they were installed instead of 500kW machines the overall power output would be much lower. By contrast, all of the 500kW machines in the diagram are illustrated as having 50m towers, even though some are actually available at 35 or 40m hub height.
The current subsidy system for wind energy, from all sizes of turbine, may be reviewed after the general election in May. David Cameron, prime minister, has suggested that a Conservative government would end subsidies for onshore wind farms because people are âfed upâ of them.
