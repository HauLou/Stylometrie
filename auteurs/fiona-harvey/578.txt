The UK is set to substantially over-achieve on its carbon-cutting targets, with potential economic benefits in cost savings and the growth of new industries, according to a government report.
Since 1990, the UK's carbon emissions have dropped by a quarter, but the report made clear that the carbon cuts of the past two decades were much easier to achieve than those needed in the next 20 years. These will require investments of hundreds of billions of pounds and the transformation of the UK's energy, transport and industrial sectors.
The research was timed to have an impact on the Durban climate change conference, taking place this week and next, because the government believes it shows that emissions reductions are achievable at a low cost, and hopes that other countries will follow the UK's example.
Chris Huhne, secretary of state for energy and climate change, said: "This sends a strong and clear signal that the UK is walking the walk on climate change â it shows other economies that, with the right planning, the transition to a low-carbon economy is achievable and affordable."
Between 1990 and 2010, emissions fell by25.2%, and the 34% carbon-cutting target for 2022 is likely to be exceeded. The government's analysis was published yesterday as the "carbon plan".
Under the fourth carbon budget, agreed by David Cameron this summer after he faced down opposition from sections of his party, the UK will need to halve emissions during the 2020s, compared with 1990 levels. Huhne said the plan should stimulate new investment and reassure businesses.
