Thousands of lives are being put at risk, and the health of many more people damaged, by the UK government's failure to adhere to strict Ministers were accused by the environmental audit committee (EAC) of MPs of "actively trying to dilute safety standards", in order to avoid fines from the EU for breaches of the rules. The government has frequently been criticised for breaches of the air quality regulations, which have led to dangerous quantities of pollutants entering the atmosphere, which can contribute to respiratory problems in vulnerable people and shorten life expectancy.
Joan Walley, the chair of the EAC, which published a report entitled Air Quality â A Follow-Up Report, on Monday morning, said: "It is a national scandal that thousands of people are still dying from air pollution in the UK in 2011 â and the government is taking no responsibility. It is often the poorest people in our cities who live near the busiest roads and breathe in diesel fumes, dangerous chemicals and bits of tyre every day."
Between January 1 and April 21 this year, at testing points in London the amount of particulate matter in the air exceeded the allowed limits on more than 35 days. Under the EU rules, member states are liable to swingeing fines if particulates exceed the limits on more than 35 days in a whole year. Last year, 40 of the UK's 43 air quality monitoring zones recorded levels of the pollutant NO2 above the safety limits prescribed. The MPs said the seriousness of the breaches was a matter of grave concern.
The lives of tens of thousands of people were being cut short each year because of the unnecessary pollution, the MPs found. "If you have heart disease, asthma or other respiratory illnesses then living near a congested road [where the regulations are breached] can literally take years off your life," said Walley.
Despite the threat of fines from the EU, the situation has not significantly improved. An estimated 30,000 deaths in the UK were linked to air pollution in 2008, according to medical experts, with about 4,000 of them in London. Last year, a similar report by the committee found that poor air quality was cutting seven to eight months from people's life expectancy, and costing the country more than £20bn a year, but in the intervening time ministers have still "failed to get a grip" of the problem, the MPs said. As a result, the lives of as many as 200,000 people could be shortened by about two years.
Instead of tackling the problem, central government is accused by the MPs of trying to pass the buck to local authorities, who will have to pay any EU fines under new requirements in the localism bill. The MPs said there were serious concerns about whether local councils had the ability to deal with the pollution. The causes of poor air quality may be beyond an individual local authority's control.
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has also applied to the European commission to extend the deadline for complying with NO2 targets to 2015.
A new national framework of low-emissions zones would provide one answer, the MPs said, as would a public awareness campaign.
Caroline Lucas, the UK's only Green party MP, and a member of the committee, said: "Ministers must take urgent action to improve air quality across the UK â and step up efforts towards a greener transport policy to encourage people out of their cars and on to public transport."
