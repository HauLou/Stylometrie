Although George Osborne was keen to underline his green credentials â as the chancellor who introduced the green investment bank and the carbon floor price â the overall message was clear, and designed to appeal to the right wing of the Tory party. It was that environmental aims should always come second to economic concerns, and if they are in conflict, business interests will win. Osborne set out clearly the government's new credo: "If we burden [British businesses] with endless social and environmental goals â however worthy in their own right â then not only will we not achieve those goals, but the businesses will fail, jobs will be lost, and our country will be poorer."

Heavy industries to get £250m assistance in the form of relief from carbon-related taxes, measures to reduce the impact on them of the electricity market reforms, and easing of the carbon price floor. Osborne: "I am worried about the combined impact of the green policies adopted not just in Britain, but also by the European Union, on some of our heavy, energy-intensive industries. We are not going to save the planet by shutting down our steel mills, aluminium smelters and paper manufacturers. All we will be doing is exporting valuable jobs out of Britain."

Electrification of the transpennine express between Manchester and Leeds, which should be greener and cheaper than the current line. A new rail line connecting Oxford, Milton Keynes and Bedford. New rail spending amounts to £1.4bn in total. There will also be extension to the London tube â to provide a station for the new American embassy on the southbank of the Thames. Numerous major new road schemes will also go ahead, for about £1bn. But no new third runway at Heathrow, despite rumours that the Conservatives were wavering on their pre-election rejection of the runway.

Cancelling the planned fuel duty rise of 3p in January, but retaining a rise of 3p in the duty from next August. Fuel duty is one of the touchstone issues of the Conservative right and a contentious issue around the country and in sections of the media. Osborne said the results of his measures would be that taxes on petrol would be 10p lower than they would have been under the original arrangements, which would mean filling up the average family car would be £144 less than it would have been by the end of next year. Note that the cost of filling up the car will still increase â just by less than it would have if the fuel duty escalator had been adhered to.

Although the "green geal" is the government's flagship policy for helping households to cut their energy bills, through access to insulation, it rated only the barest mention. An initial £200m of public funds to kickstart the deal was already announced last week.

A threat to water down some of the regulations on protected habitats for wildlife and plants, by reviewing the implementation of the EU habitat and wild birds directive between now and next March. Osborne: "We will make sure that gold-plating of EU rules on things like habitats aren't placing ridiculous costs on British businesses."

A review of the planning appeals procedures, including ways to make it easier for agricultural buildings to be converted to other uses. There was also a strong defence of the planning reforms now under way, with a vow to "go further to remove the lengthy delays and high costs of the current system", which will include new time limits on planning applications to ensure they cannot drag on, with additional costs to those applying, and new responsibilities for statutory consultees, which should also speed up the process. Osborne said: "Our planning reforms strike the right balance between protecting our countryside while permitting economic development that creates jobs."
