Uncertainty over the future of the energy companies obligation (ECO) has already resulted in hundreds of households losing the improvements they were promised, with thousands more that could be delayed or scrapped.

The Guardian has learned of at least one fully ECO-funded scheme in Sunderland worth around £500,000 that was scrapped in the last fortnight which would have equipped 100 properties in an area of severe deprivation with solid wall cladding and other insulation. The scheme would have kept the occupants warm, slashed their energy billsand created about 25 jobs, now under threat.

The ECO requires energy companies to provide free insulation and new boilers for poorer households, and subsidises insulation for "hard to treat" homes.

Three further similar schemes in the north-east involving 460 households in deprived areas, insulation for which had been arranged by the same suppliers, are now also on hold.

This is likely to be the tip of the iceberg, with hundreds of firms waiting to see the details of the government's reforms to the system before committing further investment and jobs. ECO improvement schemes have been planned all over the UK.

Jeremy Kape, director of customer services at Affinity Sutton, said: "Our modelling suggests that 15,000 of our households could benefit from energy efficiency works and reduce their fuel billsâ¦ by £4m a year. We are committed to delivering the works to achieve this, but if we lose ECO funding, we estimate that these savings would be automatically reduced by nearly half to £2.1m."

Andrew Eagles, of Sustainable Homes, said that watering down the ECO, by allowing utilities to meet their targets two years late, was a mistake as it would prevent the economies of scale that would save money in the longer term. "This is a real shame," he told the Guardian. "There is capacity in the industry to assist many times this number of people in the next two years. Pushing back targets is not the answer - scale will lower costs. ECO is the one part of the bill reducing fuel costs, so watering it down is a step back."



Chancellor George Osborne could not abandon the energy company obligation altogether, even though he may have liked to, because the mechanism is included in European law - ironically, at the behest of the UK government.

The energy efficiency directive, published just over a year ago includes a section on "energy efficiency obligation schemes" that requires member states to set up such a scheme, saving at least 1.5% of annual energy sales per year from 2014 to 2020. Member states have some flexibility in how they set up the scheme, but the UK's ECO was within the rules.

The inclusion of an "energy efficiency obligation scheme" requirement was made after UK officials urged the European Commission to accept it, citing the UK's own successive schemes obliging energy companies to help their customers save on their bills.

Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of Energy, said: "This shows how outrageously EDF Energy were behaving when they sought to blackmail the British government into abandoning the energy company obligation in return for not putting prices up even higher [when EDF announced its price rise earlier this month]. They would have known perfectly well they were deliberately inciting our government to break European law. This is disgraceful behaviour from a company predominantly owned by another European government."

Warren accused the energy companies of focusing on ECO to distract from their "price gouging" - raising prices unnecessarily high to make excess profits. He quoted the small energy company, Ovo, which estimates that the big six overcharge customers by about £3.7bn a year.

Warren said: "Home energy use has dropped by a quarter since 2005, largely owing to the installation of energy-saving measures. This has cut the energy companies' turnover badly, and that is why they are trying to destroy our nationwide energy-saving programme."

He called it "perverse logic" to help cut fuel bills by watering down the programme that helps people cut their fuel bill. He pointed out that there were already 7,000 fewer people employed in delivering energy efficiency than there were this time last year, and that at least 10,000 fewer people are likely to be employed this time next year than would have been if ECO went ahead unscathed.

But the bill for ECO could be drastically reduced if the complex processes for implementing improvements under the scheme were streamlined, according to EUM Consultants, an energy efficiency survey specialist. The consultancy said up to £610m could be saved by shortening the approval process, replacing the current assumptions on carbon savings, redesigning the criteria so the most vulnerable receive improvements first, and giving suppliers access to local authority data on which homes are most in need.

Alex Tsimboykas, director of EUM, said: "A few simple fixes could make a significant cost saving. Our message to government could not be clearer: reform ECO, do not remove it."
