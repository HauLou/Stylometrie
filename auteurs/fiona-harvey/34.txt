Smart meters that would enable people to see their own energy use in real-time will not be delivered on time on current form, depriving households of a cheap and easy way of cutting down on their energy bills, an influential group of MPs has warned.
As a result, the government-sponsored scheme to supply them risks being a âcostly failureâ, according to the energy and climate change committee.
If the meters were rolled out on schedule, with 53m of them in total installed in each of the UKâs 30m homes and small businesses by 2020, the savings in energy efficiency could amount to £17bn across the country, against a likely cost of up to £11bn to be met by consumers.
But Tim Yeo, chair of the House of Commons energy and climate committee, warned: âTime is running out on the governmentâs plan to install smart meters in each of the UKâs 30m homes and businesses by 2020 [as] a series of technical and other issues have resulted in delays. The programme runs the risk of falling far short of expectations. At worst, it could prove to be a costly failure.â
He urged ministers to get the roll-out back on track: âThe government can continue with its current approach and risk embarrassment through public disengagement on a flagship energy policy, or it can grip the reins and steer the energy industry along a more successful path which brings huge benefits for the country.â
Plans for a national roll-out of smart meters to every household have been in the works for more than five years. 
Baroness McDonagh, chair of Smart Energy GB, the organisation charged by the government with informing the public on smart meters, said the roll-out would be âone of the largest upgrades to the nationâs infrastructure that we have seen in a generation. We have an important task ahead of us to engage the whole country to ensure that every household and microbusiness will take advantage of this new technology and transform their experience of buying gas and electricity.â
But the plans have been plagued by a series of delays, both over the costs and the technology. A survey carried out for Smart Energy GB showed earlier this week that fewer than one in five people know what smart meters are, though nearly 60% of those who do know would like to have one.
One key delay has been an argument between utilities and the government on how much of the £200 cost of each installation should ultimately be added to consumer bills. For utilities, the meters are attractive because they remove the need for meter readers to visit peoplesâ homes, and they supply detailed data on customer consumption, which can be used to tailor their tariffs or for other purposes. But if consumers use the meters to cut down on the energy they waste, the utilities could lose out on sales in the longer term.The devices, which households can use to control their electricity use and heating, come in varying degrees of complexity, with simple meters showing consumption in real-time and more expensive models capable of altering the demand for electricity from appliances, for instance by turning down fridges for short periods. 
This variation has been another source of delay, as companies have wrangled over what functions should be standard, and the government has been reluctant to dictate detailed technical specifications.
The energy and climate change committee identified a series of problems with the roll-out plans, including issues with dealing with multiple occupancy buildings, the compatibility of technology from different suppliers, and a âslow startâ to generating public enthusiasm for the new meters.More than 1m smart meters have been installed so far, most of them by British Gas.
Lawrence Slade, chief executive of Energy UK, which represents the industry, said: âThe national roll-out of smart meters is one of the most significant infrastructure projects that the energy sector has seen for years. It will make estimated bills a thing of the past, help improve energy efficiency and be of great value to consumers. As with any project of this size there are many challenges to overcome and government support is essential. However, the industry is committed to facing these challenges, finding cost-effective, practical solutions for consumers.â
