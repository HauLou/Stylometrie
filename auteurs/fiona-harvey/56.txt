English wine is to be the toast of the countryâs farmers this week, with more than £100m in sales expected this year for sparkling and still varieties combined, the environment secretary will announce on Wednesday.
Sparkling wine is expected to fare particularly well, as many English vineyards are based on similar soil and weather conditions to the Champagne region of France. There are now about 470 vineyards in the UK, with an acreage of more than 4,500, up from less than 2,000 a decade ago.
Elizabeth Truss, secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, will tell a farmersâ meeting in Oxford on Wednesday: âExports of English and Welsh wine are on course to break the £100m barrier this year, two thirds of it sparkling as our confident producers take the Australians, French and Italians on at what was their own game.â
She also heralded a possible revolution in the rural economy, driven by farming and food production and also by new technology such as fast broadband.
Since the industrial revolution of the 19th century, towns and cities have been the powerhouses of the UKâs economy, but Truss predicted that the rural economy could be âas productive as towns within 10 yearsâ.
Wine is only a small part of the story: beer exports have also been breaking records, according to the Department for Environment, Food and farming is now worth £103bn a year to the UK economy, employing one in eight of those in jobs in the UK, with exports at nearly £19bn.
In a bid for the rural vote â a traditional Tory heartland â ahead of the looming general election, Truss will tell farmers: âFood and farming are a core part of our long-term economic plan and at the heart of this governmentâs agenda for Britainâs economic future.â
With a dig calculated to appeal to Eurosceptics, she will add that British farming is thriving so well that âthe French have even complained about a supposed Anglo-Saxon food conspiracy. They are absolutely right to be worriedâ.
However, farmers are likely to raise the issue of migrant workers, as the difficulty of employing workers on low wages in areas poorly served by public transport makes finding enough hands to harvest and plant crops a challenge.
Many British farmers outside fertile and rich regions such as East Anglia struggle to turn a profit as food prices have been squeezed by the supermarkets and other major agribusinesses, such as dairies, in recent years. Livestock producers have been particularly hard hit, and a large number of agricultural businesses are dependent on subsidies to break even.
Also at the conference, UKIPâs MEP Stuart Agnew is expected to argue that British farming could thrive outside the
