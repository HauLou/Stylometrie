"It's a flipping eyesore," said Maxine Sanni, on holiday from Basingstoke with her husband Addy. "What a blot on the landscape. You come to the country and expect to see a lovely landscape. And I think nuclear scares people â when tourists find out what it is, they find it frightening."
Carol Evans, from south Wales, who regularly takes breaks in nearby Burnham-on-Sea, said: "I would like to see more windfarms instead. That's cleaner than nuclear â you think of things like Chernobyl." Her husband, Gordon, added: "We have windfarms near us. We like them."
But Hayley Derry, who lives locally and works in Burnham-on-Sea, said the site did not put people off. "I think tourists have an interest in the power station, when they come down for their holidays. But they are not worried by it. I don't see it as a problem."
It is possible to approach up to the neighbouring car park of the power station and the shore beside it. Hinkley Point B is an advanced gas-cooled reactor, one of the UK's 16 remaining, and ageing, nuclear reactors.
Apart from a few small construction vehicles, there is little to show here that this is to be the site of the first new reactor to be built in the UK for nearly 20 years. Hinkley Point C, which will be constructed on land adjacent to the existing plant, will cost about £14bn and take years to build.
For the moment, work has stalled, as long-running negotiations about the premium the French company EDF will get from the government for the power have dragged on for nearly a year.
These talks are now drawing to a close â EDF is likely to receive around £90 per MWh for its electricity, via reforms to the electricity market known as "contracts for difference", whereby low-carbon power is prioritised over fossil-fuel energy. The system is complex, but enables ministers to say they are not subsidising nuclear power.
Many people living near Hinkley have mixed views about the new reactor, seeing it as a source of employment and a boost to the local economy, but also appearing apprehensive about some of its impacts.
Most of the jobs going to local workers will be in construction, or "muck-shifting", as EDF's head of procurement told the Guardian in an interview.
Ken Owen, commercial director for new building at EDF, made clear that the more advanced and technical jobs â in engineering, design, manufacturing and technology â would go to overseas firms: "There are a lot of critical components where quite frankly the UK has lost its capability. We don't mind that, because we know there is capability from a global perspective."
However, there are likely to be ancillary benefits to local services, such as retailers.
Michael Davitt, in a local shop, said: "I'm not especially happy about nuclear power, but we have regulations [for safety] and it provides employment, so people understand that."
Jill Taylor, a resident in nearby Cannington, said: "I can remember when the last [nuclear power station] was built. I worked in a hotel that was full with people coming to the area. I am all for it. It's going to bring employment and it has got to be done for the future.People these days are not looking to the future and the need to replace power. They don't look at the background."
Within two years, many of the UK's coal-fired power stations will have to be taken out of service due to EU pollution regulations, and electricity firms have mothballed many of their existing gas-fired power plants as they are more expensive to run than coal.
Hinkley Point C will not be ready in time to avoid the generation gap; even with the strike price settled, it is likely to take at least five years to get the reactor up and running. But the government hopes the new power station will be the first of several to replace the ageing fleet for the 2020s, when carbon dioxide emissions must be drastically cut from current levels.
