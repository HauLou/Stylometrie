Britain needs more "mega farms" housing hundreds or thousands of animals to keep food prices down and improve animal welfare, according to a group of influential farming experts.
Speaking at a conference organised by the Science Media Centre, Toby Mottram, professor at the Royal Agricultural University, said herds of more than 1,000 cows had "significant economies of scale". This could reduce costs while allowing yields to rise. "The industry is going to larger herds. Big may be better."
There are only a small number of mega farms in the UK at present where large animals are kept â only 17 of the UK's dairy herds have more than 1,000 cattle, for instance, though there are many more poultry farms where thousands of birds are kept together â but there are several controversial projects in planning.
One project to house up to 25,000 pigs in a single facility in Foston, Derbyshire, has been turned down by local planning officials, but may be resurrected.
Mega farms where hundreds or thousands of large animals, such as cows and pigs, are housed together in enormous sheds are controversial because the animals can be kept indoors most of the time, and sometimes for all of their lives, without seeing daylight. In some countries, such as the US, they have been blamed for the routine use of antibiotics on a massive scale, which has been associated with harm to human health, as resistance to powerful antibiotics can be passed on through the animals to humans.
In the UK, however, only 2% of dairy farms keep their cattle indoors all year round, compared with as many as 90% in the US. Concerns over the use of antibiotics on UK farms were rebuffed by the farming experts, who said the rules in the UK were more restrictive and that in the case of dairy cows, farmers would lose money if antibiotics were used often because the milk produced for three days after the treatment finished would have to be thrown away.
Christine Nicol, professor of animal welfare at the University of Bristol, said that mega farms need not mean more intensive farming. "Animals can be better cared for in larger farms," she said. "I have been on some terrible small farms, that I wouldn't care if they went out of business."
Annie Davis, chair of the Pig Veterinary Society, said that in larger farms, animals typically could enjoy more individual attention from vets: "Small farms are not going to pay for a specialised vet to come from 100 miles away."
Thousands of dairy farms have closed down in the UK in recent years: there were more than 56,000 dairy farmers in 1980, but only 14,500 last year. However, milk yield per cow has increased, so that the amount of milk produced has declined only slightly.
The experts, who also included Tim Brigstocke, policy director at the Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers, said that animals kept in for most of the time on mega farms did not suffer impaired welfare as a result, and often when given the opportunity to go outside preferred not to do so. Large animals in the UK often spend seven months of the year indoors in any case, because of bad weather, they said. Nicol said that hens observed in larger farms with good facilities, rather than the now-outlawed battery cages, were often less inclined to peck one another and showed less illness.
However, Brigstocke said that many farmers were concerned about mega farms because they did not believe it was natural for animals to be kept indoors at all times, and Mottram said that any mega farm would need to have access to an adequate area of pasture, so the animals could be fed without the overuse of fertilisers that has been associated with large farms in some countries, and so that the manure from the animals could be safely used as fertiliser.
But Helen Browning, chief executive at the Soil Association, said mega farms were bad for animals and the environment, and were unnecessary. "The problems facing the pig and dairy industries will not be solved by supersizing production â this fails to deal with the root cause of the issue. Instead we need to pay our farmers a fair price for food, while expecting the highest standards of care for our environment, animals and health in return. It really should not be necessary for a farmer to milk 1,000 cows in order to make a good living."
She added:"Large-scale indoor animal units such as this are common practice in the United States. Experience there has shown that they impact negatively on smaller, family farms, and can have poor environmental and animal health outcomes, as they produce much more manure than the land close by can use, and usually rely on high levels of antibiotics to control disease.  We should be focusing instead on the development of productive mixed farming systems that integrate the needs of animals, crops, wildlife and people in a humane and environmentally responsible way."
Many of the objections to mega farms also centre on the smells associated with them and the visual impact, as well as animal welfare.
