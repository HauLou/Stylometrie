Annual household energy bills have risen by £490 on average in the past decade with most of the increase due to the hike in wholesale gas prices, according to a report from the governmentâs climate change advisers. 
This puts the cost of government measures to support low-carbon policies at around £100 a year on domestic bills but the average household is also around £165 better off thanks to those policies â due to people installing new boilers, insulation and more efficient electrical appliances. Lord Deben, chairman of the Committee on Climate Change, the governmentâs statutory advisers on low-carbon policies, compared the spending on renewable energy and efficiency to an insurance policy against climate change. âWe take out insurance on our houses â it makes sense to insure against climate change,â he explained.
âLast year, as energy consumers we all helped hundreds of thousands of poorer people to have warmer homes and contributed to real reductions in our emissions in the fight against climate change â all for around £100 a year on the average bill,â he said. 
Deben argued that the governmentâs main policy on energy efficiency â the Green Deal, by which householders can take out a loan to pay for improvements including insulation and boilers â should be improved to give more people access to these money-saving measures.
The report, called Energy prices and bills: impacts of meeting carbon budgets, found that £55 a year of the average £1,140 household energy bill is spent on subsidising home efficiency improvements, while a further £45 went to renewables and other low-carbon electricity.
Annual bills for consumers are forecast to rise by a further £55 or so by 2020 to pay for further low-carbon investments. For commercial and industrial companies the rise will be much steeper: between 9% and 17% from 2013-20, and a further 12% to 25% by 2030. 
âThe report lays bare the potential impact of climate change policy on industrial energy prices, estimating that it could add 100% to electricity bills by 2030, which would place serious competitive pressures on heavy industry. It is vital that government starts to take a long term approach to minimising these costs for energy intensive industry,â said Gareth Stace, head of climate and environment policy of the EEF manufacturersâ organisation.
The committee reported that energy represented a small fraction of costs, at about 0.5% for companies in the commercial sector and 2% for those in industry.
Carbon reductions arising from climate change policies were the equivalent of taking 10m cars off the road, the committee said. 
Green campaigners said the report showed that low-carbon measures were good value for money, and reduced the UKâs dependence on expensive fossil-fuel imports. Simon Bullock, a senior climate change campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: âThere is a clear message for politicians: if they are serious about cutting the cost of punishing energy bills and tackling climate change, making the UKâs heat-leaking housing stock energy efficient must rise rapidly up their to-do list.â
Nick Molho, executive director of the Aldersgate Group of businesses, which support the move to a low-carbon economy, said: âThis report clearly shows that we can meet our carbon targets affordably.â
He called for the next government to âshow its support for the clean energy sector well beyond the end of this decadeâ, as cutting carbon could generate jobs and economic growth.
