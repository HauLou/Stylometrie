Rules on how buildings should be constructed so as to save energy are set to be strengthened in European member states, if plans under way from the The current directive on the energy performance of buildings, which sets certain standards for construction and refurbishment to ensure good insulation and the use of adequate materials and design, will be overhauled under the proposals, outlined in a leaked discussion document dated 30 January 2015 and seen by the Guardian.Strengthening the regulations is intended to increase energy efficiency within the EU, with a view to meeting stringent new energy targets set for 2030.The proposals for new legislation on energy efficiency would be brought forward this October, but it could take years for any changes in directives to be enforced, giving construction companies time to adjust.A UK government official said that the coalition had already taken action on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from buildings: âThe coalition government is committed to implementing a zero-carbon homes standard for new homes from 2016 and a zero-carbon standard for new non-domestic buildings from 2019. 
âWe have already strengthened the minimum energy performance requirements in the building regulations, resulting in an average energy performance improvement of more than 30%.âNew legislation to ensure that the EU meets its target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 40%, compared with 1990 levels, by 2030 is also promised, likely to include measures on the bloc-wide emissions trading scheme which covers energy-intensive industries. More research into and support for nuclear power is also on the table, but while the need for much greater progress on carbon capture and storage technology is noted, no actions are set out for how to achieve this.Under the plans outlined in the discussion document, more liquefied gas terminals would be built in northern Europe and gas pipelines across the Mediterranean, to improve security of supply. Urban transport should also be a key area of focus, the Commission believes, as traffic congestion costs The discussion paper on the The EU has even lost ground on renewable energy, once a strength: none of the worldâs top ten solar companies is European. âThese facts can no longer be ignored,â the document says.
