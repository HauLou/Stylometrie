A combination of heavy rain, bitter storms, and coastal surges. Met Office figures show that January and December combined were the wettest since records began in 1910.As the governmentâs Centre for Ecology and Hydrology notes, âthe full gamut of flood manifestations â tidal, pluvial (flash), fluvial and groundwater â has been experienced over the last eight weeks.â
The Royal Institute of British Architects estimates that 1.5% of the UK is at risk from direct flooding from the sea and about 7% of the country is likely to flood at least once a century from rivers. It says about 1.7m homes and 130,000 commercial properties are at risk from river or coastal flooding in England alone, and the effects of flooding and managing flood risk cost the country about £2.2bn a year, compared with the less than £1bn spent on flood protection and management.Because itâs easy, because people like to have houses there â and because we encourage the building of houses on floodplains for several reasons, principally cost and aesthetics.
Floodplains offer flat or flattish land that makes building streets and villages easy. Historically, people needed to be near rivers as that is where they got their water from, and towns and cities have grown up around them. Nowadays, builders like floodplains because they can acquire large cheap plots of level land.
Think of the alternative: building on hills is not as easy, the houses on hills are less accessible so people may not like them, and because houses on hills are more visible to people in the surrounding area they are much more vulnerable to objections in the planning permission process.There is no legal bar, and no national regulations, to prevent building on floodplains. And the builders who put up new homes in these areas bear none of the subsequent cost â they have long gone by the time the householders and their insurers are inundated.
Old-style flood defences made up of seawalls and concrete walls inland have gradually been recognised as ineffective.
Our habit of building on floodplains and concreting over large areas of land for housing has inhibited the ability of the landscape to absorb water. Allowing some areas to flood, usually farmland, has been a way of managing flooding for centuries, and flood defence experts are arguing for more use of such natural defences rather than simply trying to build walls to keep water out.
The Environment Agencyâs plan for protecting the UK is called Making Space for Water.
We do in most winters: itâs called snow. That is why spring is often worse for flooding than winter. If the snow melts gradually, this can cause mild flooding, while sudden thaws can lead to more serious problems. But this yearâs unusually warm temperatures have meant less snow and the unusually heavy rainfall has swept across the south and west, so the full brunt of that rain has been felt at once.Bear in mind also that the Somerset Levels, one of the worst affected areas, naturally act as a âspongeâ in absorbing water â they were marshes until drained. Thatâs where water is naturally stored in the landscape.
Perhaps not much. Dredging can help where rivers are too silted up to transport water downstream. But dredging tidal rivers is an ongoing process because silt is redeposited on every tide, and is very costly as a result. Few communities are willing to bear that cost themselves. Widening and deepening rivers also means that more of the immediately surrounding area may be made prone to flooding, so while some people may benefit others will lose out.
The Met Office has said climate change is a factor in the current floods, and projections show that this effect is only going to get worse. The worldâs, and the UKâs, greenhouse gas emissions are rising. The Committee on Climate Change has warned that we are not doing enough to adapt to the effects of a warming climate.Professor Adam Scaife from the Met Office says âwe do expect that winter rainfall is likely to increase in the future [as temperature rise]â because âas the air warms it can hold more water.â
Any cropland flooded will be seriously affected - most of the crop is likely to be lost. Farmers may be able to make up some of the damage by replanting a different crop later in the spring when the water has subsided. But while this is bad news for the farmers involved, it is unlikely to have a dramatic effect on food prices because so much of the UKâs food is imported.The combination of a high tide, a tidal surge in the North Sea, heavy rain and a lack of warning systems led to the UKâs worst flooding event in modern times, in January 1953. More than 300 lives were lost on land, and more than 200 drowned at sea. It was caused by the combination of a seasonal high tide, a storm, and an extensive area of low pressure over the North Sea that sucked seawaters to higher levels than normal. 
When the storm broke, the east coast from Scotland to Kent was badly affected. Waters spread as far as ten miles inland. That event led to the building of the Thames Barrier in the 1960s and 1970s, then the biggest single engineering project the UK had undertaken. There appears little appetite for major engineering projects today, however.The dirty secret of flooding is sewage. Under heavy rainfall, the sewage system is overwhelmed. This is not just a consequence of the UKâs sewerage systems: all sewers are designed to use water and gravity to flush dirty water away, and rainfall that is heavy enough will displace the dirty water and bring it to the surface.
That is the most unpleasant problem for householders in any flood, and the greatest threat to health after the physical threats of being washed away or hit by falling debris.
Some experts argue that sewage systems, particularly along the Thames, should be updated to deal with the increasingly heavy volumes of rain likely under climate change.Rats are displaced from their normal habitats during flooding, just like any other animal, and they seek areas where they can survive. When people are driven out of their homes, the rats can take up residence. But this should be a temporary problem: when the waters have subsided, and peopleâs homes are rehabilitated, rats will return to their usual habitats.
During floods, the most vulnerable groups are those that are always most vulnerable: the very young, the very old, the unwell, and people with disabilities. This is for various reasons: the care of very young and old people must be prioritised because of the influx of sewage that inevitably follows the flooding of homes. People with disabilities or who are unwell, particularly those living alone, may find it difficult to move to higher floors or to leave their homes and can become trapped.When homes are rehabilitated after flooding, particular care must be taken to clean up the sewage-damaged rooms, furniture and household goods â it may be best to throw out as much as possible, and replastering and repainting, new floors and other rehabilitation will also be necessary. Insurance companies should help with this. The worst thing is to try to do all this on the cheap, potentially leaving people and their property prone to further ongoing problems.
The seriousness of any flood is always subjective â it is a devastating experience for anyone, and if you are affected, it is little comfort to think that the same thing happened to others a few years before.
The 2003 floods mainly affected the south of England and in 2007 the Midlands were badly hit. Other areas affected by flooding in recent years include Cumbria and Cornwall.
The UK is prone to wet weather, probably increasingly because of climate change, and as a densely populated island it is almost inevitable that heavy rainfall over any area will cause problems.
One lesson of previous floods is that hundreds of affected people were still left in temporary accommodation months afterwards. The government has promised this time that local authorities will be able to reclaim the money they spend on this yearâs floods. Getting people back into their properly rehabilitated homes as soon as possible must be a priority.
In recent years, serious floods have struck all over the UK, from Cumbria to Cornwall. Britain is an island, and so tidal surges and storms are inevitable around the long coastline. It is also densely populated, so inland flooding â which can often be the result of local geography â affects large populations. A spokesman for the festival said this yearâs event will not be affected.
The cost could hit £1bn, according to insurance experts contacted by the Guardian.More storms are forecast in the coming days.We donât know.
The effects of flooding will certainly continue to be felt for weeks, even if the rains were to stop tomorrow (which is not the forecast). In the Thames-flooded areas, the water is likely to subside more quickly as the river transports most of the excess to the sea. 
But in another of the worst affected areas, the Somerset levels, water is likely to hang around for much longer, because the area is naturally marshy and some is under sea level, so there are fewer places for the excess water to go and the saturated ground cannot hold any more.
