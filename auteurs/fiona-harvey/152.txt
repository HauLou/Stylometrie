The government is mulling scrapping the "energy companies obligation" (Eco) â the only measure that requires utilities to help households reduce their energy bills, through insulation and new boilers. Cameron was castigated last week by fuel poverty campaigners for allegedly telling aides to "cut the green crap" from energy bills, though Downing Street later issued a partial denial.
Eco pays, through additions to everyone's energy bill, for insulation and other efficiency improvements in homes that are low-income, occupied by vulnerable people, or "hard to reach" â for instance because they require costly solid wall insulation, instead of cavity wall insulation or the much cheaper loft insulation.
The letter's signatories said the measure could boost the UK's economy by £8bn, through helping people to save on energy bills and job creation. They called for minimum annual targets for solid wall insulation, and maximum targets on easier-to-treat cavity walls.
Andrew Eagles, managing director of fuel poverty consultancy Sustainable Homes, which organised the letter, said: "Social housing providers have committed substantial time and funds to developing local programmes to reduce fuel poverty. We call on the prime minister to secure support for local jobs and for fuel poverty reduction. Annual solid wall insulation targets are essential."
But a study by Which?, published on Wednesday, suggested that the domestic energy efficiency schemes put in place by successive governments may not have achieved what they set out to do. More than half of Britain's homes â about 14m properties â still do not have adequate insulation, Which? found, though the cost of the policies aimed at insulating households is likely to reach more than £8bn between 2008 and 2015. However, the consumer organisation said the spending had not been "closely and comprehensively monitored, so it is impossible to know precisely how much [the schemes] cost and whether they provide value for money".
The organisation has suggested changing Eco so that more of the £1.3bn it is estimated to cost over its lifetime goes to cheaper measures, rather than the more expensive solid-wall insulation. It said this would reach more households for less upfront expenditure.
Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?, said: "So far, no government has got a proper grip on energy efficiency. With rising energy prices consistently a top worry for people, it's time for a radical overhaul of energy efficiency policies to help the millions of hard-pressed consumers who are facing another freezing winter."
The fate of the Eco scheme is expected to be announced by George Osborne in the autumn statement on 5 December.
