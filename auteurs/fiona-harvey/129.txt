Pursuing carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology in the UK could create a new industry worth £15bn-£35bn by 2030 employing tens of thousands of people, a report from the industry and trade unions has found.

It could also eventually cut energy bills by about £80 a year, according to the study by an independent consultancy for the CCS Association, which represents the industry, and the TUC.

CCS involves removing carbon dioxide from power stations and large industrial installations, compressing it and piping it under the ground. While proponents say the method is technically feasible, there are no commercial projects on power stations around the world as yet, though there are some small-scale trials.

If the UK is to carry on using fossil fuels such as coal and gas beyond 2030, it will be essential to cut greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with carbon budgets and the need to tackle climate change.

According to the report from the CCS Association, which represents the industry, and the TUC, the market for CCS could be worth between £15bn and £35bn in total to the UK by 2030.

This could also reduce energy bills by 2030 by about £80 a year for households by then, according to the report â however, this calculation is very uncertain given the difficulty of forecasting energy prices even a few years out.

Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: "CCS offers a way to meet our environmental targets, while creating thousands of skilled, well-paid jobs and transforming regional economies. New CCS plants would create thousands of new jobs and safeguard many more in energy-intensive industries such as steel, chemicals and cement.

"This is a great opportunity to reinvigorate our manufacturing sector and bring new R&D, design and construction jobs to areas such as Yorkshire, the north-east and Scotland.

"But without stronger government backing the UK risks losing its competitive advantage and all the jobs and economic activity that CCS could bring."

Each large-scale plant would create about 1,000 to 2,500 jobs in the construction phase, though only a few hundred while in operation. The CCSA envisages between 15 and 25 plants by 2030, suggesting between 15,000 to more than 60,000 construction jobs. The report does not estimate how much investment this would require, but few expect plants to be built for less than £1.5bn to £2bn.

A crucial further component of the economic benefit will be the supply chain, including steel manufacturers and companies involved in making infrastructure such as pipes and cement.

What is certain is that any vision of a large CCS industry will require billions in public and private investment that have so far not been forthcoming. The government has been promising sums ranging from £1bn to potentially £5bn for almost 10 years, but nearly all of the projects that have been brought forward have been withdrawn, as their feasibility has been questioned.

After protracted planning, the last Labour government finally kicked off a competition for public funds in 2007, which was carried on in a modified form by the coalition.

But by late 2011, all of the bidders had pulled out. The competition, under which £1bn in total will be made available, has subsequently been restarted and was winnowed down to two projects last spring. These are at Peterhead in Aberdeenshire, led by Shell and SSE; and the White Rose project in Yorkshire, spearheaded by Drax, Alstom and BOC.

When the projects are in operation, they will not receive a specific subsidy but could benefit from the government's electricity market reforms, under which low-carbon generation projects may gain an economic advantage in selling their energy in the market.

A spokesman for the Department for 
"We have put in place one of the best offers to support the technology in the world, with £1bn of capital funding available, operating support through the contracts for difference in our electricity market reforms and a £125m R&D programme."

A final decision is not expected until late 2015, at which time both, one or neither of the projects could gain the go-ahead. It could then take five years to become operational.

Lord Browne, former chief of BP and now a venture capitalist and chairman of the fracking company Cuadrilla, expressed scepticism over the future of the technology last week. In 2005, he led BP into one of the first CCS proposals, at Peterhead, but it was later halted.

He told a meeting of the thinktank Policy Exchange: "CCS is a very interesting idea â I tried to do the first CCS [in the UK] but there was a gap between what it would cost and what we could afford.

"There are very few places in the world where CCS could be made to work. I would not rule it out but I would not rule it in."
