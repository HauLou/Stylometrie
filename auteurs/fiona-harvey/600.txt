Solar power companies are resigned to government cuts to subsidies that have generated a boom in the fledgling industry, but community schemes to benefit low-income households are likely to be the biggest losers under the plans.
From next April, householders will have to meet a certain standard of energy efficiency before they can be eligible for feed-in tariff subsidies, designed to give people a guaranteed income for the power produced by their solar panels. Officials said this would prevent people from getting subsidies for solar power while wasting energy through draughty and ill-equipped homes.
Greg Barker, the minister for energy and climate change, said the government wanted growth in solar panel installations to continue.
"We are determined not just to drive down carbon emissions but to build a successful, thriving, prosperous low-carbon economy," he told a solar power conference in Birmingham.
"I'm personally committed to ensuring that your industry can prosper in the longer term, sustaining green jobs at a critical time for our economy, jobs that people can build a career on [and] that can help drive the recovery."
Plans for a government consultation on slashing subsidies are expected to be published early next week. Industry experts fear that cuts will be too deep to allow companies to remain profitable, potentially snuffing out the UK's solar boom.
Under current plans, the level of the feed-in tariff is likely to more than halve, from 43p per kWh to 20p. The solar industry says it can broadly live with that level, but some companies warned that schemes to provide disadvantaged communities and households with low-cost power and heating would be the most likely to be scrapped under the changes.
Professor Stephen Frankel, chair of the Wadebridge Renewable Energy Network in Cornwall, which wants to install solar panels for free to local homes, warned the cuts would endanger the project.
"The FIT underpins these installations, and the benefits then flow not to outside speculators but are retained in the area and contribute to our community fund. This fund is available for local projects, as decided democratically by local people. We are now told that the FIT is to be curtailed drastically. If that is true, our efforts to act upon government advice and encouragement will have been for naught."
Daniel Green, of the solar installer HomeSun, said people without the money to invest £10,000 or more upfront in roof panels would be hardest hit, as suppliers would no longer find it worth their while to install solar panels for them.
HomeSun is one of a range of companies fitting solar panels to homes and community buildings for free: the roof-owner gains free energy, and the subsidies are kept by the installer. Proponents of these schemes argue that it helps to rescue people from fuel poverty.
Green said: "In the residential sector, providers of free solar panels are around 50% of installations and they will disappear at anything less than 28p per kWh. This means the less well-off will not be able to benefit from solar."
He quoted a Populus survey that found that at least half of lower-income people would like to have solar panels but could not afford it. He said: "It is shocking that the government is considering reducing the subsidy which has allowed the less well-off to benefit from free solar PV. The solar industry can take a cut of 30% - any more and access to solar PV to all is gone."
Alex Lockton, of Freesource Energy, called for the government to phase in tariff cuts. "We can just about live with a 50% cut [but] the industry needs time to readjust if we are to minimise job losses. If the cut comes into force in anything less than 10 weeks, it will be a death sentence for many solar companies. It will turn one of UK plc's greatest business success stories in the last 20 years into one of the most tragic."
The government has not decided whether households and businesses should have to prove they are energy efficient by signing up to standards set under the so-called "green deal, the forthcoming government plan for encouraging insulation, or using the separate government benchmark on energy performance certificates. The difference could be important, as many in the energy industry are sceptical about the likely success of the green deal.
The feed-in tariffs are not paid for from taxation but through energy companies making slight increases to customer bills. The government wants to cap the amount paid out to about £860m, in order to curtail the potential rises to bills, but the success of the subsidies â with an estimated 100,000 installations â means that pot is likely to be exhausted much sooner than expected. Ministers also argue that as the cost of solar equipment has come down, companies can afford a cut in the subsidies.
