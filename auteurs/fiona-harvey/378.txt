Reforms to the energy market announced on Thursday will yield "once in a generation" opportunities to cut bills and greenhouse gas emissions, according to the energy secretary, Davey hailed the new energy bill as "the biggest transformation to Britain's electricity market since privatisation" and the product of a "grand bargain" within the coalition â the legislation has taken months of tough negotiation between the parties.
Under the new bill, companies producing low-carbon energy â including renewables such as wind and solar power, and nuclear power â would receive a higher price for their energy than for that produced in fossil fuel power plants. But the prices will not be set until next summer, at the earliest, leaving investors in such power plants hanging. The government has also refused to set a date of 2030 for "decarbonising" the UK's power generation sector, as campaigners had urged.
As a result of the continuing uncertainty, potential investments worth tens of billions in new manufacturing capacity for offshore wind and other renewable energy are still on hold, as investors weigh the UK government's commitments against those of rival economies. None of these details will be available until the middle of next year at the earliest.
Davey said: "The energy sector can play a major role in stimulating economic growth, creating jobs, and positioning British companies for success in export markets."
Green campaigners had been hoping for more â both the Liberal Democrats and Labour favour a target of ensuring that the UK's electricity generation would be largely dependent on low-carbon sources, including renewables and carbon capture and storage technology, from 2030. That target is in line with a trajectory to meet international commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050. The chief executive of Vestas, the world's biggest wind turbine manufacturer, told the Guardian such a target would generate new investment.
Joss Garman, political director of Greenpeace, said: "There is a gaping hole in the energy bill in the shape of a 2030 decarbonisation target. Billions of pounds of investment rest on this target being made law. Without it, there is serious risk of an investment vacuum after 2020, and of jobs and money being lost to our economic rivals."
Under the proposed reforms, household energy bills should be, on average, between 5% and 9% lower than they would be otherwise between 2016 and 2030, despite the probability of rising fuel prices, if the government's forecasts are correct. The UK should also be able to meet its internationally agreed targets to cut emissions by more than a fifth by 2020, compared with 1990 levels. Talks are going on under the United Nations in Doha, Qatar, this week, on a new agreement on greenhouse gas emissions to be put in place after 2020.
However, crucial details were missing from the energy bill. These include details on the support for the nuclear power industry, which is expected to receive a minimum price for electricity generated under the reforms. That price is expected to be greater than that for renewable energy such as offshore wind, but the details of how much taxpayer-funded support will be available for each technology will not be available until next year. That is likely to delay investments, industry experts have warned.
The move to improve the UK's creaking energy infrastructure is a huge undertaking that will outweigh investments in telecoms, water, and transport, and will come in at several times the cost of the Olympics â as much as £200bn may needed to be poured into the energy sector by 2020, according to government estimates. But the money is needed because of decades of underinvestment, in large part because the (mostly foreign-owned) privatised energy companies over the past two decades have sought profit over investment in the future.
Davey argued on Thursday that investing in the energy sector could stimulate economic growth. "Industry and investors have told us very clearly that government has to play its part, by creating a regulatory framework against which they can invest and by giving them clarity on the level of incentives available," he said.
"We cannot afford to miss this opportunity â we need those shovel-ready projects [such as home insulation] to get under way now, and the energy security challenge we face is real, with fossil fuel imports set to increase, electricity demand to rise, and around a fifth of our existing power plants to close by 2020."
But campaigners said the energy bill was a "lost opportunity" to make substantial changes to the UK's energy infrastructure and would fail in the long term, because it did not give investors enough incentive to put money into renewable energy rather than gas or other fossil fuels.
The forecast cuts in bills would come largely from energy efficiency measures to be supported by the government.
