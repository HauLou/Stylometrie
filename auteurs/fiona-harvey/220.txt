The government's new scheme to protect homes in England and Wales from flooding vastly underestimates the number of properties at risk due to climate change, says a study from the London School of Economics (LSE).
As many as 800,000 homes in England and Wales are likely to be at significant risk of flooding in a decade, even on optimistic assumptions of fewer homes being built in flood plains, with the number rising to 1.5m by 2050. That compares with about 370,000 homes at significant risk in 2008 in England and Wales.
But the government's new "Flood Re" insurance system, devised with the insurance industry, assumes that only about 500,000 properties will be at risk. The £180m a year scheme is to be paid for by a £10.50 levy on all home insurance, from homeowners who are not at elevated risk of flooding as well as those who are.
The LSE study found that these risk assumptions could put the new scheme â set to come into force in 2015 and last to at least 2035 â in danger of failing vulnerable homeowners.
The authors found: "The design of the Flood Re scheme has not taken into account adequately, if at all, how flood risk is being affected by climate change. For this reason, it is likely to be put under increasing pressure and may prove to be unsustainable because the number of properties in future that will be at moderate and high probability of flooding has been significantly underestimated."
The paper has been submitted to the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) as part of a consultation on the policy.
Defra said it would not respond until the results are published in October.

The rising levels of coastal, river and surface water flooding means that about 6m properties across the UK are at some risk, though in most cases it is not a high risk. However, few properties are equipped with flood defences such as "skirting" and barriers, in part because owners fear this could put off future buyers, and in some cases because insurance companies do not provide for such defences when they compensate customers after floods.
The new Flood Re scheme was announced this summer, after years of wrangling between the government and the insurance industry. Previously, all homeowners could gain insurance even if they were at high flood risk, but the industry was increasingly worried about the escalating costs of providing this.
Properties are defined as having a significant flood risk if they are judged to have more than a 1-in-75 chance of flooding in an average year.
