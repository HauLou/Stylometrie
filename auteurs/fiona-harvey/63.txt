David Cameronâs former top climate change aide has lambasted world leaders for failing to show up to the crucial informal dialogue session following Tuesdayâs climate summit at the UN in New York.
After a day of set-piece speeches by leaders including Barack Obama that yielded little in the way of new commitments, world leaders were supposed to meet over dinner to discuss climate change, and engage in âsoft diplomacyâ to iron out differences ahead of crunch negotiations on a new global climate agreement.But many prominent heads of state and government stayed away from the summit altogether, or failed to show at the dinner.Greg Barker, former climate minister and the adviser who played a key role in Cameron interest in green issues, including orchestrating his famous trip to the Arctic, told an audience in New York: âPresident Obama is a few blocks away [from the dinner] at a party in the Waldorf-Astoria. Chinaâs [premier Xi Jinping] is thousands of miles away. The prime minister of India [Narendra Modi] could not make time for it. The chancellor of Germany [Angela Merkel], the biggest economy in Europe, is in Berlin. We will never get a deal on climate change if leaders donât turn up.âRussiaâs Vladimir Putin also stayed put in Moscow, and the count of world leaders reached just above 120 out of a possible of more than 190.Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, called the summit in an effort to make much-needed progress before crunch talks next December in Paris, at which world governments are supposed to forge a new global agreement on the climate, including national commitments on emissions curbs beyond 2020, when current targets run out. The last time that leaders met in such fashion was at Copenhagen in 2009.The decision by the Chinese, Indian and Russian premiers to snub Tuesdayâs UN summit, held the day before the annual general assembly, was viewed with dismay by many.âThis was supposed to be pivotal: Obama and Jinping in a room, eyeball to eyeball,â said a senior participant in the talks. âEveryone knows that the US and China [the worldâs biggest emitters and economies] are the pivot. But it didnât happen.âChinaâs vice premier Zhang Gaoli told the summit: âWe will announce post-2020 actions on climate change as soon as we can, which will bring about marked progress in reducing carbon intensity, increasing the share of non-fossil fuels and raising the forest stock, as well as the peaking of total CO2 emissions as early as possible. 
âChina will advance a revolution in energy production and consumption, cap total energy consumption, raise energy efficiency and vigorously develop non-fossil fuels. We will step up efforts against air pollution, promote ecological progress, establish a carbon trading market at a faster pace, intensify technological innovation and raise public awareness of green and low-carbon development. 
âBy so doing, China will blaze a path of sustainable development that leads to both economic growth and effective tackling of climate change.â
Foreign ministeri Xie Zhinhua made it clear in a press conference that engagement would be on Chinaâs terms. âChina is a developing country,â he said. âWe have 18m people living in poverty. China has paid equal attention to growth, mitigation [of carbon dioxide emissions] and adaptation [to climate change]. We are similar to developing countries and the least developed countries, we are on the same page as these countries.âHe emphasised Chinaâs insistence on the principle of âcommon but differentiated responsibilitiesâ, intended under the Kyoto protocol of 1997, when Chinaâs economy was much smaller, to ensure that developing countries could continue to increase their emissions while developed countries had to reduce theirs.September 22, 2014

However, one new factor in the negotiations leading up to Paris is that China has just surpassed the European Union in annual greenhouse gas emissions per capita. Previously, along with other developing countries, China has argued that as its emissions per person were much lower than in the developed world, it should take on less responsibility for emissions cuts.September 23, 2014
This woman was my favourite marcher on Sunday, but time now to smarten up & brief PM for #Climate Summit. pic.twitter.com/5AEmR2OyvD
Cameron attended Tuesday nightâs dinner at UN headquarters in Manhattan, seated between South Africaâs Jacob Zuma and Dilma Rousseff, president of Brazil. He was also one of many world leaders present, including François Hollande of France and Hassan Rouhani of Iran, who had one-to-one meetings with Ban during the day, though the edited versions released publicly afterwards revealed little of note.
Cameron did not attend the climate march on Sunday, when hundreds of thousands of people in New York, London and cities around the world urged leaders to take stronger action on global warming, but Barker took to the streets of New York with model Lily Cole.
