Speculation over the worth of the UK's shale gas industry has veered between the enormous â enough to fuel the entire country for decades to come according to estimates from the British Geological Survey â and the negligible: several big gas players, including BP, Shell and Centrica, have said the amount of shale gas likely to come from the UK was nowhere near enough to trouble investors.

That speculation has been turned on its head. Centrica has taken a 25% in Cuadrilla, the only company to have started shale gas fracking in the UK. But the amount the company has paid for its stake tells us more about the likely worth of the UK's shale gas industry than any of the wild pronouncements yet.

Centrica will pay £40m for a 25% stake in Cuadrilla's main shale gas field in Bowland, Lancashire, giving the shale gas driller a presumed value of £160m. There is also the small matter of £60m that 
Cuadrilla has already sunk more than £100m into drilling for shale gas in the UK, most of it in Lancashire's Bowland shale, with not a penny yet to show in gas production, and with many setbacks â it has been forced to cease drilling in Lancashire after two small earth tremors at one site and fears for wildlife at another. The company is also looking to drill in Sussex, where its preliminary drillers recently started work in Balcombe, but it faces strong local opposition.

The amount Centrica is prepared to pay reveals the appetite â or lack of it â for investors in the UK's putative shale gas fields. Lord Browne of Madingley, former chief executive of BP, and now chairman of Cuadrilla and a director of its venture capital backers, Riverstone Capital Partners, told the Guardian earlier in 2013 that he would ensure the company and its backers invested "whatever it takes" to make shale gas in this country a viable industry. It seems that Riverstone did not have enough enthusiasm, or capital, to do that alone.

Valuing Cuadrilla â which is the only company yet to have fracked in the UK, and the owner of the licences to frack most likely to bear early fruit â at only £160m in nominal terms is a severe blow for those who think the UK's energy future is homegrown gas. That low valuation should cause serious worry on the right wing of the Tory party, many of whom have been advocating a "dash for gas" as a cure for the UK's energy woes.

But fracking is no easy solution. As the International 
Gas is not a low-carbon fuel, whatever its proponents may claim. It is a fossil fuel, and greenhouse gas emissions from fracking are higher than from conventional gas. If it is not carried out properly - ensuring no methane leaks out - they can even be higher than the emissions from burning coal.

Thursday's leap by Centrica into the shale gas market reveals what few in the fracking fraternity have been willing to admit â that the value of the UK's fracked gas market is low, and that the probability of the UK becoming a global centre for shale gas production is slight. The government should not be pinning its hopes on shale gas for the UK's homegrown energy future.
