millions living in fuel poverty. Protestors chaining themselves to the gates of the first new indigenous source of fossil fuel since the North Sea oil discoveries. Warnings of power blackouts within three to five years from the government's top energy official and energy company bosses. An ageing fleet of nuclear power stations and a damaging stand-off over the site of the only new reactor yet in planning. A dearth of investment in crucial infrastructure.
The UK's energy sector has not faced such an extraordinary combination of dire problems since the crises of the 1970s â and even then help was on the horizon in the form of North Sea oil and gas. Policy interventions by government will be vital to solving the multiple looming difficulties and encouraging the massive investment needed from the private sector. But time is running out. The UK's remaining coal-fired power stations are having to reduce their hours of operation â under European Union regulations on pollution â so replacing that capacity is a matter of urgency.
Baroness Verma, UK energy minister, acknowledged that the UK was facing "a number of unprecedented challenges" â not least that electricity use is set to rise as we use more power for heating and transport â but said that government plans laid out in this year's energy bill would set the framework for increasing energy generation. She forecast that the measures would bring about investment of £110bn by the end of this decade.
She said: "Electricity Market Reform [EMR] provides support for low-carbon technologies in the short to medium term, in order to work towards a long-term vision. This vision is of a competitive market in which all technologies participate on a level playing field, without financial support."
Under EMR, energy suppliers will be able to enter into long-term contracts and will be supported by "capacity payments", by which generators will guarantee to have enough power at hand to provide for peaks in demand, and "contracts for difference" by which low-carbon energy generation will receive a premium over high-carbon fuels.
Key details of how some of these mechanisms will work were set out over the summer, including the "strike price" on contracts for difference for various forms of renewable power, but some details remain unresolved. These include exactly how the capacity market will work in practice, and the strike price for nuclear power at EDF's proposed new reactor at Hinkley Point. The latter has been the subject of a tense stand-off between the Treasury and the French state-owned utility, with the government taking the view that EDF's current demands for price assurances are too costly to the consumer.
Key to the government's thinking on energy policy is the need to moderate fuel prices for consumers. Baroness Verma told a meeting of the all-party parliamentary environment group: "The coalition is determined to help consumers with the rising cost of living. Our current Electricity Market Reform proposals are set to deliver the affordable energy bills, cleaner energy and reliable supplies that we need."
So far, however, the energy industry remains to be convinced, and investors have been slow to come forward. Plans to convert the Tilbury power station to biomass were shelved over the summer, offshore wind construction has not kept pace with forecasts, and there is currently only one new gas-fired power station under construction in the UK. Industry insiders are sceptical that the government can provide sufficient reassurances in the short term to kickstart the massive sums needed over the next few years. Another issue is the heavy reliance of the UK energy sector on overseas utilities: with Germany undergoing its Energiewende and France and Spain in financial difficulties, these companies are likely to concentrate their efforts on their home markets with less investment and management time available for the UK, analysts fear.
This uncertainty is affecting the wider economy, too. Manufacturers are concerned about the future of power supplies, and about the cost. Jeremy Nicholson of the For some in the government, the example of the US offers a lifeline out of the current energy muddle. Shale gas exists in vast quantities in geological formations in the north of England, and may extend over much more of the country, recent geological analysis has found. There could be enough to meet the UK's needs for decades, if estimates are correct.
However, the key questions are: can it be extracted at economically viable rates and without doing serious environmental damage? In the US, shale gas extraction has been associated with air and water pollution, the despoliation of the landscape and the over-use of water that has left some communities high and dry. Protesters against shale in the UK also argue that it will increase greenhouse gas emissions, through the use of the gas and the flaring of methane that will happen at some sites. A Guardian poll found 40% of voters against shale gas exploitation in their area and 40% in favour, with the rest undecided.
The government, however, is determined to press ahead, with energy secretary Ed Davey setting out the case for shale this week and the chancellor, George Osborne, offering substantial tax breaks to the industry, as well as promising at least £100,000 for each community affected and 1% of the revenues.
Renewable companies are looking on with trepidation. While RenewableUK and other industry bodies insist that gas can be a transition technology on the road to renewables, sections of the coalition government are touting shale gas as an alternative â and cheaper â investment than wind, solar or other renewables. The economics of this may be questionable, but the argument has found a popular resonance. New plans by the environment secretary Owen Paterson to investigate whether onshore wind farms have an effect on nearby house prices show which way the wind is blowing in some quarters. Added to that, the government is firmly opposing in Brussels proposals for a new renewable target for 2030, to take over from the current 2020 target to generate 20% of energy from renewable.
With a year and a half of the current coalition government to go, and new details set to emerge soon of EMR and EU policy â to say nothing of continuing UN negotiations on climate change, set to culminate in 2015 â the coming months will be crucial in determining the UK's energy future for years to come. Energy policy will remain at the centre of government thinking and for the UK's industrial and investment sectors, but the intractable problems of how to generate more electricity more cheaply and with less carbon will not be solved in the short term.
