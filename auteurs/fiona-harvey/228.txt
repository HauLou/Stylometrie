Drilling for oil started on Friday just outside the small village of Balcombe, in West Sussex, as oil and gas company Cuadrilla completed tests of its equipment and protesters chanted outside, surrounded by police.
This is the first time Cuadrilla, which is pioneering the controversial technique of hydraulic fracturing or "fracking" in the UK, has been able to start its exploratory drilling. The company says is not planning to frack the rocks under Balcombe at this stage. Its geological assessments suggest there could be oil accessible under the surface, and drilling a vertical well into the rocks may be enough to bring it up. However, if this does not work, it may drill horizontal wells to get at the oil, then resort to fracking in future as a third option.
The protests over the past two weeks delayed operations "by no more than a few days", a spokesman said, adding: "We support people's right to peaceful protest. And if people break the law, they will be arrested by the police on the site."
More than 30 people had been arrested by Sussex police as of Friday night, with the prospect of more arrests if the protests intensify now that drilling has begun. About 75 police officers have been deployed on the site.
Protesters vowed to continue their attempts to blockadethe site, which prevented some lorries from making it through but failed to stop Cuadrilla bringing in the equipment needed. They have been undeterred by heavy rain, the hottest day of the year, and the unpleasant effects of the spraying of slurry on an adjacent field.
Vanessa Vine, a local resident who has led the campaign, said: "We will certainly fight on. This should not be allowed to carry on. There is tremendous solidarity here. We have slowed things down a bit [for Cuadrilla] and have raised awareness of this ruination of our countryside."
None of the protesters believed Cuadrilla's protestations that it was not intending to frack. "That's what they say, but wait and see," said Ben, who preferred not to give a surname. "They are a fracking company, that's what they are about."
They are then funnelled to the surface through pipes for collection. However, without the correct equipment gas can easily leak or needs to be flared, as frequently happens in the US. Environmental experts have also claimed instances of water and air pollution from fracking sites.
Balcombe's protesters oft-cited concerns are about their water and air quality, the despoliation of an area of natural beauty, the effect on house prices (falling, according to some residents), the disturbance of the traffic to and from the site, the possibility of gas flaring, and the effects of fossil fuel burning on climate change.
Though sections of the protest have come under fire for being "professional" protesters â there are a sprinkling of tents bearing slogans from the Occupy movement â locals are very much in evidence.
One resident said: "We thank protesters who have come from outside for showing their support. They have been giving us very helpful advice, too. Without them our little protest would have just been snuffed out."
Manuela Warburton from Balcombe said: "This is a highly populated area, and it is just not the right place for this sort of industry. We were not consulted enough. They should be looking at more sustainable and less damaging forms of energy.
Miranda Diboll, who brought her four-year-old daughter Rebecca from the neighbouring village of Cuckfield said: "There is a lot of feeling among the local people. I'm seeing mums I know from the village school turning up with their children, showing support, people I've never spoken to about fracking. We don't feel local people have been properly consulted. But we are succeeding because at least now a conversation is happening about this."
Rafe Asher-Harris, 17, of Balcombe, said young people had been enthusiastic about the protest. "I think we've been having a very positive effect." Charles Metcalfe, also of Balcombe, said: "It's ridiculous that they're doing this. If we have to make changes to our behaviour, consume a little less, save energy, that is what we should do, not this ripping up of the landscape."
A survey found more than eight out of 10 local people oppose the drilling, and a sizeable proportion of the cars passing the camp toot their horns in support.
But not all the locals are sympathetic. A farmer with the field adjoining the site has taken his large muck-spreader to spray liquid slurry from a height all over the pasture, separated from the protest camp only by a thin hedge. The stench is overpowering and some protesters are worried about the effects on the many children in the kids' play area and on the cook tent. Vine said: "This is petulant, aggressive and irresponsible behaviour."
Questioned by the Guardian, the farmer ("my surname is Farmer, first name Local") said the manure spreading had been to "make the grass grow".
Cuadrilla's main fracking operations are in Lancashire, where the company has suffered a series of delays and setbacks, and spent more than £100m without yet producing any gas or oil. Two small earthquakes two years ago were found to have been caused by the drilling, and the company's senior management was censured by former energy minister Charles Hendry after failing to report that one of its well casings had been deformed, perhaps as a result of the seismic activity. No gas or fluid leaked from the damaged casing.
It could be many months or even a year before Cuadrilla knows if it will need to frack to extract oil at Balcombe. The company is applying for an extension to its current drilling licence to carry on exploration.
