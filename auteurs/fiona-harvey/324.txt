Government plans to make it easier for housing and other developments to go ahead are pitting local communities against town planners and creating a "war" in the British countryside, the National Trust has warned.
"If you start trying to build houses where people don't want them, rural Britain becomes a warfare area," said Sir Simon Jenkins, chairman of the charity. "Everywhere you go people are fighting applications for [land] development."
Ministers have targeted planning rules as part of a programme of deregulation that would favour development such as new housing, transport links, industry and other infrastructure â provided it is "sustainable". But the definition of what is sustainable, and how far it will satisfy environmental concerns as well as those of local residents worried about their amenities, is so far unclear.
Local authorities have until the end of the month to develop local plans, setting their own priorities for development in their area. But new research by the National Trust shows that about half are likely to miss this deadline. The trust is urging an extension, in order to allow local authorities to draw up their own priorities rather than have them imposed.
Jenkins, who has been outspoken in his opposition to windfarms and other developments, warned that the move to loosen the planning regulations would prove counterproductive as more local people took exception to planning permission applications. "It will not produce more housing but just more conflict," he said. "Everyone will spend their time fighting, and fighting, and fighting."
The National Trust is one of the fighters, with an involvement in a wide variety of cases against housing developments, windfarms and other infrastructure. "We spend our entire time in court," said Jenkins.
He said it was one of the worst years for conflicts over planning permission â "I can't remember anything like this" â and that there was a "virtual collapse" of town and country planning as authorities struggled with the new rules as well as budget cuts.
The National Trust is not against development, however. Helen Ghosh, the new director general of the charity, who took over in November, pointed out that planning permission has already been granted for an estimated 400,000 new homes in sites around the country, but that these were not being taken up, while developers have been still pushing for more sites.
The National Trust is also concerned about shale gas fracking, which is likely to produce more conflicts with planners in the next few years as companies bid to explore areas of the UK including the Lake District and Northern Ireland. It is "disappointed" that the government has chosen to designate only 31 areas of sea around the coast as "marine conservation zones" where fishing will be limited, rather than a potential 127.
Ghosh has written to the environment secretary, Owen Paterson, on the issue but not yet received a reply. Formerly a career civil servant, she was for five years permanent secretary at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, though she left the post to join the Home Office before Paterson arrived.
She said another of her priorities was to expand the trust's use of new technology, such as apps which people can download to hear guides to its properties.
The trust is also gearing up to combat the deadly ash dieback disease. It will cost an estimated £1.5m a year for the next decade for the trust alone, in lost timber sales and the costs of dealing with infected trees.
