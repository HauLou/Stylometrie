The UK will play host to one of the first large scale demonstration of plants for advanced biofuels â liquid replacements for petrol made from waste materials â under plans to be unveiled by the coalition today.
The government is to offer £25m as the prize for a competition to come up with the most viable demonstration plants for liquid fuels made from waste organic material, such as straw or wood waste.
Advanced biofuels â which avoid the controversial problems of existing biofuels, which are made from products such as wheat or maize that could also be used as food crops â are an important goal for environmentalists who want to reduce the carbon emissions from the transport industry. Attempts to manufacture liquid fuels from waste have been going on since the late 1960s, but while experiments and lab bench tests have met with limited success, none has yet borne fruit at the level needed to be commercially viable.
Ministers believe that research has now reached a stage where advanced biofuels will be commercially possible. The department for transport said its initial soundings from industry had indicated there are potential projects and a good deal of interest, and it expected "high quality" bids for the 25m on offer, which would be matched by private sector investment.
Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat transport minister, told the Guardian: "It's hugely important that we decarbonise transport. We have been up hill and down dale on biofuels in the past few years. What we need to do is distinguish between good biofuels and bad biofuels, and this competition will produce good biofuels."
The first step will be a feasibility study that will set out the design of the competition and the criteria that need to be met by any bidder. This stage is expected to take four or five months, after which bids will be accepted. A winner could be announced within a year, but the process could take longer depending on the bids lodged.
Any potential methodology or feedstock will be considered, as long as they can be proved to produce carbon savings over conventional fuels and come from feedstocks that are environmentally sustainable.
Though there are demonstration plants for such fuels in countries such as the US, there are no advanced biofuels yet in widespread production. First generation biofuels, using grains or oil-bearing plants such as palm oil, have come under severe fire from environmental groups, who accuse their manufacturers of putting fuel before food, and raising the prices of staple foods such as bread because of the competition for fertile agricultural land between food and fuel crops.
