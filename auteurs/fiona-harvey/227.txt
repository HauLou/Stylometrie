But even with the caveats, this was the biggest expression of enthusiasm for new gas power that the UK has seen in some time. The government is desperate to bring new gas-fired energy generation on stream, as a way of avoiding shortfalls in electricity supply when ageing coal and nuclear power stations are taken out of service. But there is a marked absence of building projects and a distinct chill where new investment is concerned.
At least 14GW of new gas-fired power stations have received planning consent, according to the Department of Scottish and Southern Energy made a pointed reference to the government's electricity market reform, which aims to ensure that there is enough investment in power generation to avoid blackouts, while meeting 2050 greenhouse-gas targets. On top of that, electricity supply must be cost effective, even though a key part of government energy policy is the so-called capacity mechanism, which will put gas-powered plants on standby to fill gaps in solar and wind-powered electricity supply.
SSE said: "Although projects such as Abernedd are close to being 'shovel-ready' and others such as Keadby 2 are at an advanced stage of development, unless there is a significant change in UK government policy around EMR [electricity market reform] and the timing and operation of a future capacity mechanism, and clear market signals suggesting the need for increased gas-fired generation capacity, SSE does not expect to take any final investment decisions to construct these projects until at least 2015. This will effectively mean no new capacity will come into operation until 2017/18 at the earliest, given the lead times for constructing new CCGT plant." RWE npower said it had applied for a permit at its Willington site, but that this was "in the very very early stages".
The mismatch between the government's aspirations and the industry's actions is growing larger. Ministers need to show progress by the next general election if their energy strategy is to have any credibility. Ed Davey, the energy secretary, told the Another key advantage, from the coalition's point of view, is that gas stations can be constructed relatively quickly, taking about two to three years and costing about £1bn each. With energy chiefs citing the danger of power shortages in years, gas could be used to plug the gap. So why aren't companies following the government's script?
Part of the reticence is down to the government itself. Investors are waiting to see how the capacity market, or those power plants designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs in low-carbon generation, will work in practice. One energy executive said: "We are like everyone else in this industry â waiting to see the details of what the government comes up with and whether it works."
But, more worryingly for the government, the economics of gas are also unattractive. "No one is making money on gas," said another industry insider. "The margins are so thin. Coal is making piles of money."
Peter Atherton, energy analyst at Liberum, said companies also faced the prospect of building plants that would be running at only a fraction of their capacity for most of their 25-year lives, in order to meet the government's carbon budgets in the 2020s and 2030s. Plants could end up operating at only 20% of capacity, or being kept on standby to be used only during the winter peak, he said. That, together with poor economics of gas at present, added up to "far too much risk" for investors, he said. "The attractiveness of gas has gone from being a small positive to a massive negative."
Energy UK, which represents the energy industry, said companies would need further reassurance from government and better market conditions. A spokeswoman said: "People need to have confidence to build any form of major project and, when it comes to gas power stations, continued uncertainty weakens market signals and undermines confidence that new investments will make a profit. The department of energy said that it was for private sector investors to make their own decisions on infrastructure investments. "It is a commercial decision for the applicant to decide whether or not to proceed with the proposed project."
