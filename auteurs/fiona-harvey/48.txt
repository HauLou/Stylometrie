The small, picturesque village of Balcombe in west Sussex became synonymous with fracking â and the opposition to it â nearly two years ago when plans emerged to test local land for oil drilling. That summer, the Balcombe protests propelled the issue of shale gas and oil to the forefront of public debate, sparking demonstrations elsewhere and a mass petition to Westminster.
Now the focus of protests has moved elsewhere, but the villagers are continuing their anti-fracking revolution in the form of a new, carbon-free, source of energy for the area. An array of solar panels, paid for by a fundraising drive among residents, were switched on at a nearby farm this week, giving villagers an alternative vision of clean power.
On Grange Farm, about 4 miles from Balcombe, 69 panels have just gone up on the south-facing, second-storey roof of a large byre. They will generate about 1% of the communityâs electricity needs, offering the power first to the farm, which has a herd of beef cattle, sheep, poultry and a shop selling fresh produce, as well as outbuildings housing other small businesses. (âItâs nice to see the cowshed roof being put to good use. The cows donât seem to have noticed,â said the owner, Chris Jarvis.)
But even as they celebrated the project, which has taken 18 months from conception, through planning, legal hurdles and fundraising, to finally generating clean energy, the volunteers responsible were facing the possibility that this first success might also be their last.
Tom Parker, along with fellow volunteers in the REPOWERBalcombe group, said he was worried about tax code changes that will come into force from April.
âIâm not sure that we can carry on,â he admitted. âWe put a huge amount of time and effort into setting up the group, and administrative costs, such as accounting and legal costs, are a big expenditure for us, as everything else is done by volunteers. So it would be really difficult for us to change all that now and start again.â
Community renewables experts have said the changes will severely inhibit the ability of local groups to form the legal entities and raise the funds necessary to put up new solar panels or wind turbines. Existing groups face having to change their legal structure or make a much less attractive appeal for funds.
The changes relate to the tax relief currently offered to such schemes, in recognition of the benefits they offer in local growth and investment. The tax relief, under the Enterprise Investment Scheme rules, currently forms an important part of the financial planning for these projects, which typically spend nearly all the money on technology and infrastructure, and a minimum on administration. Many co-operative schemes depend on being able to claim the relief in order to sell shares in their projects, and offer a decent rate of return to attract investors.
The EIS for renewables is being replaced with Social Investment Tax Relief, which co-operatives will not be able to take advantage of unless they change their legal structure to become community benefit companies. The government has said the change means new community groups will still be able to form, and existing ones to carry on building renewables, but those involved have said it will become much harder, and the solar industry has said there is uncertainty about the long-term future of SITR.
The Balcombe array is capable of generating 18,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a year, cost about £30,000 and will generate a 5% return for investors, with an extra £1,000 a year going to a fund to tackle fuel poverty and energy efficiency. But REPOWERBalcombeâs plans for similar arrays at three schools are in jeopardy, as the group must raise £300,000 before the end of the current tax year in early April, to avoid falling foul of the upcoming regulatory change.
Jackie Emery, a group member, said the process of getting all the legalities in order for the initial array was hard enough. âItâs taken a lot; there were times when things seemed to progress very slowly,â she said. âI believe that in 10 yearsâ time we will have solar panels everywhere and people will see it as normal, but it has been a big effort for us.â
The new rules risked causing further confusion in an already complex field, said Julia Groves, chief executive of Trillion Fund, which crowdfunds for clean energy projects.
âWe do not as yet have clarity on exactly which tax reliefs and subsidies will apply, and in what combination, depending on how the community group is structured,â she said. âAnyone in the renewables industry will tell you that uncertainty like this is a real challenge to an industry that is not yet at scale.â
Another concern was the future of feed-in tariffs, the premium rates that solar generators are paid for their electricity. These subsidies, intended to promote the growth of renewable energy and bring down its costs, have been subject to sweeping cuts and rule changes under the current government, prompting unease among investors and the renewables industry.
Leonie Greene of the Solar Trade Association said: âThe new FIT rules which will allow communities to run a 5MW project alongside a commercial developer 5MW project are too constrained to allow any real growth. This is a real shame since there is huge interest from the solar industry in doing this.â
Groves said the government should be doing everything it could to encourage the schemes, âwhich ultimately benefit all of us.â
There are serious doubts among renewable energy enthusiasts over the governmentâs commitment to clean power. David Cameron said last autumn that onshore wind turbines should no longer receive subsidy and that people were âfed upâ with them, despite polls showing public support. In October, Liz Truss, environment secretary, called solar arrays in the countryside a âblightâ on the landscape.
Alasdair Cameron, renewable energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: âThe fact that the government continues to undermine community renewable energy by removing tax relief, while giving huge tax breaks to the fossil fuel industry, says a lot about its priorities.â
He called on the government to allow investments in renewable projects to be included in ISAs, and to allow schools to borrow money to invest in solar energy.
For Parker, the view from the Grange Farm roof is as clear as the cold winter sky: the government has turned its back on its promises of a renewable future, and he blames the big six energy suppliers. âIf you look at Germany, the community renewables sector has grown very big, and it is making a dent in the big electricity companiesâ profits. They [the big six] donât want that to happen here,â he said. âI donât understand, otherwise, why the government would not want local cooperatives to do this, to generate their own energy. Weâve shown it can really work.â
