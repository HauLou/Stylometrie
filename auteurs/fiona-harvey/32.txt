Shale gas exploration can be environmentally sound, and should be the centrepiece of the next governmentâs energy policy, the Conservativeâs most senior green-leaning MP has urged.Tim Yeo, the Tory former minister, and chairman of parliamentâs energy and climate committee, said the time had come to make the âgreenâ case in favour of fracking, and that the incoming government after the general election must seize on the technology for the good of the UKâs environment and economy.
âThere is an opportunity now, and it might not exist in a few years [when other European countries have developed fracking],â he told the Guardian. âPeople who think fracking is an environmental problem are mistaken.â
He said that the regulations governing fracking in this country were sound, and that related problems such as tremors were very small, and there would be no danger to the water supply here, as there has been in some places in the US. âOnce people see that horizontal drilling is not causing earthquakes or poisoning the water they will be satisfied,â he said.
While warning that shale gas would not be the âtransformationalâ industry it has been in the US, where the widespread exploitation of fracking technology has sent gas and oil prices tumbling, Yeo said it would be cheaper for the UK and have less impact on the climate than importing gas.
Fracking involves blasting water, sand and chemicals at dense rock to release tiny bubbles of gas trapped within, but the technology has been slow to be adopted in the UK after a series of hitches in the first targeted sites.
At the general election, Yeo will leave parliament after 32 years , having been de-selected by his constituency party, apparently for spending more time on national than local issues. A former environment minister and shadow environment secretary, he is one of the longest-standing and most influential champions of green issues among the ranks of Tory MPs, and chairs the influential parliamentary cross-party select committee on energy and climate change.
He makes his last major speech on energy and the environment on Thursday, at a conference that will highlight some of the committeeâs progress on making policy recommendations in the current parliament. 
He has chosen to make the green case for shale gas as his parting shot, because he believes the coalition has been too timid in persuading the public of the value of shale. Yeo has no current financial interest in shale and does not intend to take up any such interests on leaving parliament.
He will also use Thursdayâs speech to argue strongly in favour of onshore wind turbines, which he will say are a cheap and reliable form of low-carbon energy. David Cameron has vowed to end subsidies for onshore wind, despite polls showing most people are in favour of the turbines.
Yeo said that reducing the UKâs greenhouse gas emissions would still leave the country reliant on gas for years to come, and that fulfilling heating and power needs using domestic sources of gas would be both lower in emissions and cheaper than importing liquefied natural gas from overseas.
âI yield to no one in my desire to [tackle climate change] but the fact is we will not get by without consuming a lot of gas between now and the 2030s, so better to have a domestic source than to import it,â he said. âI do not think that a single extra cubic metre of gas will be consumed in the UK because of a domestic fracking industry.â
He said many green groups were opposing fracking because of a âvisceral reaction to anything involving fossil fuelsâ, but he said the UK could meet its commitments on carbon reduction while producing gas from shale.
He will tell the conference: âThe next government must stand up to the fuzzy-headed ideological fringes that oppose fracking. The greens opposed to fracking do not have evidence on their side.â
He will add: âToo many of us take the ready availability of energy, and the prosperity it makes possible, for granted. We expect electricity and gas to be constantly available - but we wonât accept the energy infrastructure on which that availability depends.â
