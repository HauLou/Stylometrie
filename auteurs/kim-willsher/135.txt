A draft health bill presented to French ministers on Wednesday aims to target binge drinking by hitting people who incite it with â¬15,000 (£12,000) fines and sentences of up to a year in jail.
The proposed legislation makes encouraging âle binge drinkingâ â the English term is most often used â a specific offence and is aimed at combatting alcoholism among the young.

The bill, to be presented to the Assemblée Nationale early next year, could put an end to âbizutagesâ â initiation ceremonies often carried out at universities and higher education establishments, which often involve encouraging new students to get roaringly drunk.
The bill also contains measures aimed at preventing illness and improving public health. These include requirements for greater information to be given to consumers on mass-produced food, blank cigarette packets to discourage smoking and, most controversially, what have been called âshoot-up roomsâ for drug addicts to inject themselves in a safer environment.

In June 2013, research by the National Institute for Prevention and The institute said the problem was growing, with 25% of 15-30-year-olds questioned admitting having drunk at least six units of alcohol on one occasion at least once in the previous month.
The legislation was drawn up before the summer but was reportedly diluted amid protests from medics and budget constraints.
