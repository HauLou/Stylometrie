A Roma teenager is in a coma in hospital after being attacked by angry residents of a French housing estate who accused him of breaking into an apartment.
The 16-year-old was found badly beaten in a supermarket trolley in which he had been left near the nationale 1 motorway in the Seine-Saint-Denis area near Paris late on Friday.
The youth, named only as Darius, suffered multiple head injuries and has been placed in an artificial coma by doctors.
Police say he was dragged out of his unofficial camp by a dozen locals, who accused him of breaking into a nearby flat earlier on Friday. The group took the youngster to a cellar and beat him.
"A group of several people went to find him in the camp and took him by force," a police officer told Le Monde.
The teenager's mother alerted the police, who found him severely injured and unconscious shortly before midnight. The victim was taken to hospital, where his condition is said to be critical.
Police say while the teenager was known to them and had been linked to a number of thefts and break-ins and for driving without a licence, he had not been convicted of any crime.
"The motive of this lynching, it was vengeance," prosecutor Sylvie Moisson told reporters, saying the teen's condition remained life-threatening. "To practically condemn him to death is barbaric."
Police have interviewed a number of witnesses and are examining CCTV images. The youth was reportedly pushed into a Renault Clio around 5.30pm on Friday by a group of armed men.
A police source suggested there were four kidnappers, but a Romanian garage owner opposite the Roma camp said his wife had warned him a group of a dozen hooded youngsters were causing trouble, according to Le Monde. A few hours later, Darius's mother received a call made from her son's mobile telephone allegedly demanding a â¬15,000 (£12,000) ransom for his safe return.
The French president, François Hollande, said the attack was "unspeakable and unjustifiable â¦ and against all the principles on which our republic is founded."
Bernard Cazeneuve, the interior minister, also strongly condemned the attack. "I remind people that it is exclusively up to [public] security forces to ensure public order. The police have been mobilised to rapidly shed light on this affair, arrest the culprits and bring them to court."
The prime minister, Manuel Valls, said it was an "unacceptable act".
Geneviève Garrigos, president of Amnesty International Anti-racism organisations say there is a disturbing increase in violence against Roma. SOS Racism said the attack was caused by an alarming change in attitudes towards Roma, which it added was "the clear result of the disgusting tensions into which our citizens have been plunged".
In February the case against a 40-year-old man accused of throwing a mixture of bleach and cleaning fluid at Roma living near the Place de la République in central Paris was dismissed by a judge for lack of evidence.

In May 2013 several Gypsy families were attacked at a campsite in the north of France, and in October 2012 locals drove a group of Roma out of an improvised encampment and burned everything that remained. Local people had warned police they would be taking action against the 35 Roma.
Last year the EU warned France it could face sanctions over the treatment of its Roma community after Valls, who was then interior minister, suggested that most should be deported and France was "not here to welcome these populations".
European commission spokesman Olivier Bailly said that Roma, like all EU citizens, had "the freedom to circulate freely in all member states of the EU and to live in a country other than their country of origin".
The European Grassroots Antiracist Movement (Egam) president, Benjamin Abtan, said: "There are racist insults and attacks against the Roma that are being used with increasing frequency. We are waiting for a radical change in the way this is being addressed and an extremely clear condemnation of the violence."
