The morning after the press conference before, the reaction of the French media was as many felt it should be.
There was less concern about the Socialist president, François Hollande, trundling along the boulevards of Paris on a scooter to meet his girlfriend (while the "first girlfriend" stayed at home) than about his political decision to take what is seen as a sharp right turn down a side street.
In short, it mattered less that he was cheating on his partner than that he had become a social democrat. In any case, only the perfidious and prurient "Anglo-Saxonne" press was interested in the former.
There was hardly a word either about Valérie Trierweiler â packed off to a hospital for her own good with a "serious bout of blues" after learning of her partner's infidelity, or sidelined for the good of the president amid concerns that she could make serious trouble? Nobody knew and nobody asked.
"I am a social democrat," Hollande defiantly declared at the press conference the previous afternoon, adding that he would remain one, however many times the question was asked.
It was not a matter of choice that he was pledging less welfare and tax cuts for businesses, he said, but a matter of necessity, in his own words "a social compromise".
The French papers compared Hollande to Germany's Gerhard Schröder, chancellor between 1998 and 2005 and a member of the Social Democratic party of Germany, and suggested that the president had abandoned socialism and chosen "third way" politics.
Libération's headline, "Hollande Libéré", made a play on the French word liberer (to free) and liberale (indicating an advocate of the free market).
"By claiming the 'social democrat' line yesterday, the head of state clarified his political position at the risk of being accused of turning liberal (free market)," Libération wrote.
"Social democracy: Holland comes to terms with it," said the inside page headline. Trierweiler and the president's â alleged â affair were relegated to a sidebar on page 3.
Even the more populist Le Parisien stuck to politics with its headline "High voltage", adding: "In front of the press the president announced a series of economic and social measures while remaining very discreet about his personal situation that he will clarify later."
Le Figaro's front page had a picture of the president and the words: "A verbal U-turn".
Meanwhile, another U-turn that nearly went unnoticed: on Tuesday, the French satirical magazine Le Canard Enchaîné reported that the culture minister, Aurélie Filippetti, had nominated the actor at the centre of the scandal, Julie Gayet, to be on the prestigious seven-member Villa Médicis jury that decides which young artists get to go to the French Académie in Rome.
This, it suggested, belied the notion that the "Hollande affair" was private and nothing to do with politics. "Did François Hollande ask for this nomination? Did Aurélie Filippetti take the initiative?" asked the centre-right Le Figaro.
By Wednesday morning, it was being made clear by French officials that Gayet would not be nominated to the Villa Médicis jury.
Where the president's personal tribulations were mentioned by the French media, it was through the prism of the foreign press, thus allowing them to report developments while appearing to be above it all. British and American media were variously described as "ironic", "disconcerted", "astonished", "electrified" and "grasping at revelations".
"Affaire Gayet: the Anglo-Saxon press is astonished at the prudence of French journalists. British newspapers criticise the 'deference' of the French press, while the Americans are thrown by the respect for their private lives afforded political leaders," wrote Le Figaro.
"The Hollande-Gayet affair electrifies the foreign media," announced Le Monde's political page.
Le Parisien said the "willingly impertinent" British press had "waited with delectation for a flurry of questions on the French head of state's relationship with a 41-year-old actor".
Only Le Figaro appeared to notice that the French embassy in London had declared war on "French bashing".
Vive l'Entente Cordiale!
