The Chinese have panda diplomacy. The Russians, it appears, prefer trees.
France may have just announced it is delaying the delivery of two warships to Russia in a protest over the crisis in The gift, which reportedly cost â¬80,000 (£64,000) to transport and install on in the square outside the cathedral on an island in the river Seine, came after parishioners and local firms failed to raise enough funds for a seasonal tree. It was unveiled by Russiaâs ambassador to âThis year, for the first time in the history of Paris, the Christmas tree has come from âWe want to show by this gesture, that despite the efforts to isolate Russia, the friendship between our two countries is so strong and deep that no politics can destroy [it].â

Monseigneur Patrick Jacquin, the rector at Notre Dame, said he had appealed to several foreign embassies, including Austriaâs, Ukraineâs and Russiaâs, for donations after his congregation failed to come up with enough money for the tree.
âThe Russian authorities were the most reactive and very quickly gave their green light,â Jacquin said. âOur church has no money,â he added.
Paris city hall said it had not been approached about financing a tree.
Understandably, the Russians have been making the most of their moment of
