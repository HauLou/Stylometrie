It may be one small step for cooking, but it is a giant leap for haute cuisine.
Duck breast with capers, Breton lobster, organic quinoa with seaweed and celeriac puree, lemon chutney and chocolate cake are going where little fancy food has previously ventured â¦ space, the final frontier.
Nasa has commissioned one of the most celebrated masters of Gallic gastronomy and a Breton canned meat company to come up with fresh, "special occasion" menus for astronauts and cosmonauts in the Alain Ducasse, the most Michelin-starred chef on the planet, has been sending food out of this world since 2006. So far, international astronauts have enjoyed what he describes as "food for extreme pleasure", including the Sicilian speciality caponata, roasted quails in a Madeiran wine sauce, celeriac puree with nutmeg and "melt in your mouth" apple slices.
Ducasse's hi-tech food laboratory has also been commissioned by the Now he has teamed up with the Brittany family firm Hénaff â more famous for its tinned meat and pâté, favoured by long-distance mariners â to provide the containers to ensure the Ducasse delicacies lose none of their flavour on their 200-odd-mile journey to the ISS.
A spokesperson for Ducasse told the Guardian: "We've been sending special dishes to the space station for seven years and change the menu regularly. We're happy to be working with Hénaff, who we chose because they meet American standards." However, she added: "We won't be sending tinned pâté into space."
Before linking with Hénaff, Ducasse had feared he may have to move his space meal kitchen to Houston, Texas, to meet exacting US hygiene regulations.
In total, Nasa and its astronauts have chosen 25 Ducasse recipes. The astronauts will try out the food at Houston during their training to ensure it is to their taste and they have no allergic reactions.
"Special occasion" meals are enjoyed on the space station â first inhabited in November 2000 and continuously occupied ever since â on birthdays, holidays, and whenever a crew member goes on a mission outside the station or there is a change-over of staff.
The ISS orbits the Earth just over 15-1/2 times a day at an altitude of between 205 and 270 miles and an average speed of 17,100mph. On non-special occasions, crew members eat preserved food in vacuum-sealed plastic bags, which are, reportedly, as popular as the average school dinner.
The first of the new dishes is expected to take off next June.
