Above the din of jostling television crews and camera flashes, a shrill wailing could be heard from behind the guarded double doors of the Metropark Lido hotel's second-story ballroom.
More than 100 relatives of passengers on Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which vanished an hour into its Beijing-bound flight from Kuala Lumpur at 1.30am on Saturday, had been waiting in the room for more than 36 hours. The few that ventured into the media scrum outside wore expressions of anxiety and despair. Some huddled in corners in the hotel's atrium, quietly crying.
At one point, a young man approached local journalists to ask for the latest news; he said that the airline hadn't told him anything. One journalist asked him if he was a family member. "Yes â all my family is up there, except for me," he replied, and burst into tears.
Zhang Zhilin, from the nearby metropolis Tianjin, sat in a stairway awaiting news of his 26-year-old cousin. "I don't understand," he told the Wall Street Journal. "We have all the technology in the world these days, and how is it that we can't locate them?
As air and sea rescue teams broadened their search for the wreckage on Sunday, personal details of the 239 crew and passengers continued to emerge. According to a list released by the airline, the passengers came from 14 countries: as well as 158 Chinese citizens, there were 38 Malaysians, seven Indonesians, seven Australians, five Indians, four Americans, two New Zealanders and one Russian.
The oldest person on the flight was 79-year-old Chinese national Lou Baotang. Among five small children â three from "She often said that she smells her baby from head to toe," said one of Jiao's former colleagues. "People at the company really loved her."
The large cohort of Chinese citizens included a group of Buddhists who had flown to Kuala Lumpur to participate in a religious event on 2 March.
Also on board were 24 Chinese artists who had travelled to Kuala Lumpur for a cultural exchange exhibition. They included celebrated calligrapher Meng Gaosheng, 64, and Memetjan Abra, an ethnic Uyghur painter from the north-western region of Xinjiang.
"He is a good painter, husband and father," his wife Memetjan Abra told Xinhua, China's state newswire, on Sunday. She said she had spoken to Abra on Friday night, just before he boarded the plane.
Hélène Conway-Mouret, the junior minister for French citizens abroad, confirmed there were four French passengers on the flight. Laurence Wattrelos, 52 lived in Beijing and was travelling with her 17-year-old son, Hadrien, his 18-year-old French-Chinese girlfriend, Yan Zhao, and 14-year-old daughter, Ambre.
All three teenagers were students at the French Lycée in Beijing, where Wattrelos was vice-president of the parent-teacher association. "I wish to send a message of support and solidarity to the families of those who disappeared on flight MH370 during this difficult time," said Conway-Mouret.
In Kuala Lumpur, Mohammad Lokman Hamid, 31, only discovered his sister Norli was on flight MH370 when he logged into Facebook this morning and saw her status update, which she had posted last night. He then discovered, also on Facebook, that the plane had gone missing after losing contact with Malaysia's Subang air traffic control at 2:40am.
"I knew they'd been planning to go to Beijing for a holiday, especially after she suffered a miscarriage," Hamid said of his sister Norli Akmar, 33, and her husband Mohd Razahan Zamani, 23. "I'm terribly worried as too many speculations have been made about the incident. Some even say that the aircraft had issues with its global positioning system (GPS). I just hope that my sister and brother-in-law, as well as other passengers on board the aircraft, are safe."
Reporters at Kuala Lumpur international airport found Norli's father, a police officer, waiting for news from the airline along with many other families and friends of missing loved ones. Some of them clutched their passports as they waited to be flown to Vietnam.
Hamid Ramlan, 56, said the family had spent the day grieving at their expected loss. "My wife is crying. Everyone is sad. My house has become a place of mourning," he told AFP. "This is Allah's will â we have to accept it. Being a policeman over 33 years, this is my worst day."
In Kuching, the capital city of Sarawak on the Malaysian island of Borneo, police chief Roslan Bek Ahmad confirmed his niece, Suhaili Mustafa, 31, was one of the 227 passengers bound for Beijing. He was leaving for Kuala Lumpur to take emergency leave to be with his widowed sister, Malaysia's news agency Bernama reported.
Two New Zealanders were registered on the flight: Ximin Wang, 50, and Paul Weeks, a 39-year-old mechanical engineer, who was traveling from his home in Australia to Mongolia for work.
Weeks' wife, Danica Weeks, told reporters on Sunday she was praying for a miracle to bring him home. "I can't give up hope. I would love him to walk through that door, hold him one more time," she told Australia's Nine News. She recounted his last day at home with their two sons â one aged three, the other 10 months â and said he left a wedding ring and watch in the house.
"[He said] 'If something should happen to me then the wedding ring should go to the first son that gets married and then the watch to the second'," she said.
The disaster has resonated nationally in China, coming one week after a gruesome knife attack in the southern city of Kunming that left at least 33 people dead and scores injured. "Pray for Malaysian Air" was a trending topic on Sina Weibo, the country's most popular microblog, on Sunday night, with many users posting emoticons of flickering candles and beating hearts.
"MH370, we hope the radar can see you," said a widely forwarded post on the messaging app WeChat. "If you copy, keep flying at your current height until you reach your destination. We'll clear the way for you. Everybody is more than happy to let you be the first to land.
"The sky is clear, with temperature in Beijing at five degrees Celsius, a little bit cold. Please wear your coats to keep warm. Remember to hug your family and friends after you disembark. They love you, they really do."
