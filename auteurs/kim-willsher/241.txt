Using handheld cameras and with a shortage of both money and celluloid, François Truffaut, Claude Chabrol, Jean-Luc Godard, Éric Rohmer and Jacques Rivette â among others â created a golden age of French cinema.
Their influence spread far. The American director Martin Scorsese once said: "The French New Wave has influenced all film-makers who have worked since, whether they saw the films or not. It submerged cinema like a tidal wave."
Later Agnès Varda, a photographer turned filmmaker, would become a leading member of the movement, but the female stars of the Nouvelle Vague were the actors; Brigitte Bardot, Jeanne Moreau, Fanny Ardant, Catherine Deneuve, Anna Karina ...
More than 50 years on, French cinema is still part of the country's The evidence will be on view in London and elsewhere in the Rendez-Vous with French Cinema film festival, which begins this week. The French Centre National du Cinéma et de l'Image Animée says the country's film industry is undergoing a feminine renaissance. According to its research, 23% of feature-length films were directed by women last year, up from 18.4% in 2008.
Comparative figures are harder to establish elsewhere. In the US, a study commissioned by the Sundance film festival and Women in Film found that female directors were depressingly under-represented in Hollywood, though more active in independent films. Between 2002 and 2013, only 4.4% of the most successful films were directed by women, its survey found.
Even at Sundance, which prides itself on gender equality, women represented fewer than a third of workers on the 820 narrative and documentary films that have featured in the festival since 2002 (though, in 2013, the balance was being redressed, with half the films in the festival's dramatic section directed by women).
Isabelle Giordano, executive director of UniFrance Films, which promotes the country's film industry abroad, commenting on a recent survey which found around 25% of film producers in "I don't know why it should be so, but it is. We have been told that in other countries, women have difficulty raising the money to make films, which isn't particularly the case in France, so maybe this is why. And maybe it reflects French society, where we have a lot of working women. In any case, France is a good country for women in all aspects of the film business."
Until now, the British cinemagoing public has proven stubbornly resistant to the charms of French movies, Giordano said. She is hoping this year's selected Rendez-Vous films will shift attitudes the other side of the Channel.
"They all tell stories in an original way that is very different to what Hollywood offers," she said. "We'd like British cinemagoers to come and see something they may not have seen before; even if it's a common theme, it's often treated in a different way in a French film."
Among the festival offerings is The movie's central theme will be familiar to those who have seen Hollywood's "cougar" films: older, recently retired woman has an affair with younger, sexually voracious man.
Vernoux's direction and Ardant's touch, however, transform the subject into a delightful, touching and funny story that avoids plummeting into cliche and stereotype.
"A cougar? I most certainly am not. Good grief!" Ardant told the Ardant was discovered by international audiences in 1981, when she starred opposite Gérard Depardieu in Another film featuring in the festival is The films, all due for release in the UK this year, include None of the French actors who spoke to the Kiberlain, who won acclaim for her portrayal of Simone de Beauvoir and a César â the French equivalent of an Oscar â for her, at times hilarious, interpretation of the workaholic, friendless judge in Speaking to the "I do feel that I have been rather egotistical and I rue not having been one of those people in Italy or Germany struggling for something. I have a certain sympathy for those guys in Colombia, what are they called? The Farc."
It is difficult to know if Ardant is serious. Probably not. She has form for making mischief in interviews with contrary and provocative declarations.
"I once convinced a journalist that my father was the star of Not surprising, then, that Ardant was having none of the "I detest the whole notion of films made by women, for women, starring women," she says, adding: "Perhaps it was my generation, but I was never a feminist: I found it all too narrow.
"I like the woman I play in "I like her character. She is uncompromising... and so am I."
