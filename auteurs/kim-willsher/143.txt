They were among historyâs most celebrated lovers: Napoléon Bonaparte and Joséphine de Beauharnais. Now, the marriage contract signed by the lovestruck pair on 8 March 1796 has been sold at auction for several times the estimated price.
The document, until now held in a private collection, was De Beauharnaisâs copy and gives her full name of Marie Josèphe Rose Tascher de La Pagerie. It was signed the day before the marriage and three days before Bonaparte left Paris for Nice to take command of the army of Italy during the French revolutionary wars.
It had been estimated to be worth â¬80,000 to â¬100,000 (£49,000 to £61,000), but was sold after furious bidding on Sunday to the Paris Museum of Letters and Manuscripts for â¬350,000 without auctioneerâs commission and fees (â¬437,500 including auctioneerâs costs).
The contract was drawn up a year after the couple met and two months after Bonaparte, then a young general, proposed to De Beauharnais, the sophisticated and worldly widow of a guillotined French revolution general. Although his family disapproved, Bonaparte was besotted and described his fiancee as âworse than beautifulâ.
The contract states that the pair have âno common propertyâ and that neither should be held âresponsible for the debts and mortgages of the otherâ. It records De Beauharnaisâs age as four years younger than she was; in fact, she was six years older than Bonaparte.
The couple were married the next day at the town hall in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris, and the contract was registered on 18 March. Bonaparteâs copy of the three-page contract is held in the French national archives.
At a previous auction, in 2007, a love letter from Bonaparte to De Beauharnais, written before they were married, also sold well above the pre-sale estimate. In it, the future emperor wrote: âI send you three kisses â one on your heart, one on your mouth and one on your eyes.â
The coupleâs marriage was annulled in 1810 after they failed to have children, but they remained lifelong friends. On hearing of her death in 1814 of pneumonia, while he was in exile on Elba, Bonaparte is said to have locked himself in his room for two days refusing to see or speak to anyone.
The private Paris Museum of Letters and Manuscripts already boasts 136,000 documents, including the coupleâs original divorce papers, bought in 2007 for â¬120,000. It also has the script of the Marquis de Sadeâs infamous 120 Days of Sodom.
The latter work, which the aristocratic author described as âthe most impure tale that has ever been told since our world beganâ, was written on a 12-metre-long, narrow scroll discovered in a niche in a cell at the Bastille prison where De Sade was held during the French revolution. It was acquired by the museum in April this year.
