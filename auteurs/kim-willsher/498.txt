Anyone who has ever visited Paris â or any major city this side of the Channel â in summer can vouch; the French do like their vacances.
Public schools close for at least two months in July and August while many municipal sports centres, stores, restaurants and businesses shut up shop as families head for the beach or the countryside, leaving a "Back in September" note on the door.
Or so the stereotype goes. However, a poll has shown that there may be more truth to the caricature than previously imagined.
The study by Harris Interactive claims Britain's Gallic neighbours take more holidays than anyone else in Europe â an average of 30 days compared with 26 elsewhere on the continent and 15 worldwide.
And economic crisis or not, the French intend to carry on doing so, with 72 % planning at least as many holidays in the next 12 months, and 10% to take even more.
Many of those taking fewer days off â around 11 % â are not doing so for financial reasons, but because they want to accumulate time off to get away for longer next year, says the poll. Of the French quizzed, 60% said they had never cancelled or postponed a holiday for work reasons.
The Japanese take the fewest holidays, with almost a quarter of those questioned by pollsters claiming they had never taken time off for a vacation.
Harris concluded that when it comes to holidays, the French are like the Brazilians in terms of behaviour and tastes: they like their getaways long and hot and in the company of family or friends.
The findings appear to confirm a recent report by the French government economic and statistical research agency Insee, which found that in 2010 French salaried workers took on average 6.2 weeks of paid holiday or days owing (having exceeded the 35-hour working week), corresponding to 37 working days. Insee reported that executives took 41 days, nine days more holiday than manual workers.
A survey by Le Monde before this summer found that of the 26.2 million French planning to take their holidays in July and August, 70% of them were holidaying in And as anyone who has visited France in September knows, this is the time of "la rentrée" the great return to school and work and the real beginning of the French year.
