London and Paris â or Paris and It threatened to be an uneasy double act when the pair met on Thursday. After all, Anne Hidalgo once described London as a suburb of Paris, and âWelcome Borisâ, said Hidalgo as the pair took to the stage at Parisâs city hall. âMerci Anne,â replied the London mayor.
Johnson began by expressing, in what he promised would be âbarbaric Frenchâ, Londonâs solidarity with He pointed out to his Spanish-born, French naturalised counterpart that the Tricolor had been flown in Trafalgar Square and atop Nelsonâs Column. There were a few splutters from the audience. Paris and London, he concluded, had the same ideas about freedom of expression.
âAh Boris, tu es Charlie?â retorted Hidalgo, referring to the slogan that has been taken up to show solidarity with the journalists killed at Charlie Hebdo magazine. âYes, je suis Charlie,â he replied.

Hidalgo, however, was determined to be diplomatic. âI adore London and its mayor is simply an icon, not just in London, but here too,â she said to more splutters and chuckles.
The rivalry between the two cities was âstimulating and interestingâ, she said, adding: âWe do not run each other downâ.
Well, not much.
