What would Asterix make of it? Actor Gérard Depardieu, the celebrated Gallic hero's cinema sidekick, is leaving 
The 63-year-old star has bought a house in the Belgian frontier town of Nechin to add to a property portfolio that includes a chateau in Anjou, vineyards in France, Morocco, Spain, Italy, Argentina, Algeria and Ukraine, three Paris restaurants, a fish shop and a motorbike concession.

Daniel Senesael, the mayor of Nechin (population 2,000), announced that Depardieu had purchased the former local customs officer's house and would be moving in immediately.

Depardieu was arrested for drink driving last week after falling off his scooter in Paris, is facing legal action for assault after an "altercation" with a motorist in August, and last year caused a scandal by urinating in the aisle of an aircraft en route for Dublin.

Senesael admitted that some might consider trying to avoid domestic taxes equally outrageous.

"I understand it could shock," he said.
