The former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has told supporters that the countryâs same-sex marriage law should be scrapped.
Sarkozy, who is campaigning to lead the opposition centre-right UMP party and is expected to run again for president in 2017, was speaking at a debate organised by the conservative Common Sense (Sens Commun) group on Saturday.
Referring to thepassed by Franceâs Socialist government last year, he said it needed ârewriting from top to bottomâ.
His comments, two weeks before the UMPâs hotly contested leadership election, prompted catcalls from the 3,000-strong audience and cries of âRepeal! Repeal!â. Sarkozy, appearing rattled, responded: âIf youâd rather one says repeal the law and make another one â¦ in French, thatâs saying the same thing. It comes to the same result. But hey, if that makes you happy, then frankly, it doesnât cost much.â
Sarkozy explained he was in favour of some form of marriage for same-sex couples, but something different from that for heterosexuals. He said he opposed surrogate parenthood for same-sex couples.
The same-sex marriage legislation is known officially as the Taubira law, named after the justice minister Christiane Taubira who oversaw its introduction.
âItâs no use being against surrogacy if you donât repeal the Taubira law,â Sarkozy said to cheers and applause.
The former president, who has been married three times, has previously criticised the legislation, saying it was âhumiliating families and humiliating people who love the familyâ, but it is the first time he has called for its repeal.
An Ifop poll published on Saturday found that 68% of respondents supported same-sex unions and 53% supported adoption by same-sex couples.
Sarkozyâs comment and apparent policy-making on the hoof brought angry reactions from the governing Socialist party, which accused him of âappealing to the most reactionary instincts of his core supportersâ. A spokesperson said Sarkozy wanted to create âa new form of segregationâ with his two-tier marriage proposal.
The anti-gay marriage group La Manif Pour Tous (Demonstrations for All) cautioned that Sarkozyâs âconversionâ to its cause was still only a âdeclaration of intentâ.
