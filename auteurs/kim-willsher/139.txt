Given â¬20m (£15.5m) of taxpayersâ money, what would Parisians do to improve their city? The final answer is expected after voting closes on Wednesday in the French capitalâs first âparticipatory budgetâ.
City-dwellers of all ages and nationalities were given the chance to choose from 15 projects, including walls of vegetation, pop-up swimming pools and mini âlearning gardensâ in schools. The most popular will be included in the 2015 cityâs spending plan. Work will begin on them in January.
The cityâs mayor, Anne Hidalgo, said allowing people to decide the destination of 5% of the city hall investment budget every year from now until 2020 was âhanding the keys of the budget to the citizensâ.
Parisians were given a week to vote, either online or at As voting ended on Wednesday, the most popular choices reflected concern with the environment and the shortage of green spaces in the city centre, and a desire to breathe new life into its gloomiest corners.
A â¬2m project to cover at least 40 âblindâ walls with plants to cheer up local areas and create a âmicroclimate and biodiversityâ had received the most votes.
The second most popular was a â¬1.5m scheme to use derelict and abandoned areas around and under the Third was a â¬1m project to introduce âlearning gardensâ in all infant and primary schools.
Other projects on the ballot included mobile rubbish collection points to improve recycling; co-working spaces for students and young entrepreneurs; the renovation of the cityâs 33 music stands for public concerts; sealing off some roads at certain times to allow children to play without fear of traffic; and pitching tipis around the city for children to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries.
At the Canal St Martin in the cityâs popular 10th arrondissement, curious Parisians clustered around a transparent mobile voting box last weekend. Youngsters on bikes who had already filled in their voting slips cycled back and forth urging those present to âvote for the swimming poolsâ.
Unfortunately for its supporters, as voting drew to an end, the swimming pool project â at â¬8m the most expensive on the list of 15 â had dropped to 13th.
Socialist Hidalgo, 55, who became the first female mayor of Pauline Véron, deputy city mayor in charge of local democracy, said Parisians would eventually be asked to suggest their own projects.
There are similar âparticipative democracyâ schemes in hundreds of cities, including Toronto, Canada, and Porto Alegre in Brazil, which was the first to introduce it, in 1989, as well as in smaller communes in Hidalgo said the idea was âa new tool for citizens to participate allowing all Parisians to propose and choose projects that will make the Paris of tomorrow. They can have a real effect on local life. I see it as a major democratic innovation.â
