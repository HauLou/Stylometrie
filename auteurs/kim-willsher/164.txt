The French prime minister, Valls urged rebels in the party who are angry at the administration's swerve away from traditional leftwing policies to show some restraint and "self-respect".
His appeal came a week after he dissolved the government following public criticism from an outspoken senior cabinet minister. Speaking at the closing of the Socialist party's annual summer conference in the historic port of La Rochelle, Valls told the audience: "What unites us must be stronger than our differences."
He added: "To govern Valls said there was a "moral crisis, identity crisis, civil and democratic crisis and a crisis of values". He warned of the emergence from the shadows of a Front National "credible enough to govern", profiting from a divided and fractious left and the equally divided and squabbling opposition UMP party.
"I understand that many of our compatriots, of our citizens, including those within our ranks, have doubts, questions and uncertainties â¦ we have never known such a political threat as with the advance of the Front National. Faced with this situation, it is normal, healthy, useful that there are questions and debates."
However, he warned: "We must pay attention to our choice of words, to our attitudes, to our behaviour, to the way we speak to each other. We must be above reproach. If we respect ourselves, we will be stronger to get our message across to the French people."
Mention of the government's responsibility pact â which includes a promise to reduce social charges levied on French companies in return for them taking on more staff â brought whistles from the audience.
"I ask Socialists to stand up and say: 'Yes, these policies are necessary,'" he said, adding that the government had no intention of changing the 35-hour maximum working week, a totemic policy of the French left.
"We are not engaged in austerity and it's this that marks us out from the right. If there's a political confrontation and a debate to be had, it's not within the Socialist party. It's with the right," he added, prompting a standing ovation.
He concluded his rousing speech by telling the audience: "So, dear friends, I ask you, let us not caricature our own action. Others will do that for us. Be proud of what we are engaged in."
Valls formed a new administration last Tuesday after asking President François Hollande to dissolve the previous government following dissent from Arnaud Montebourg, the economy minister, and two other ministers on the left of the party.
Montebourg triggered the crisis by calling for an end to "austerity policies" imposed on France by Germany. "France is a free country that shouldn't be aligning itself with the obsessions of the German right," Montebourg had said, urging party militants to mount a "just and sane resistance".
His comments elicited sympathy from the culture minister, Aurélie Filippetti, and support from the education minister, Benoît Hamon. All three ministers were omitted from the new government, as Valls, an unabashed social democrat who has been compared to Tony Blair, was forced to reassert his authority over the so-called Jean-Christophe Cambadélis, leader of the Socialist party, told the conference audience: "We are faced with a historic challenge, to put France back on its feet to put the left back on its feet, and to put the left back on its feet to put France back on its feet."
Valls was greeted with angry whistles from militants and a shout of "to the left" on arriving at La Rochelle. The prime minister told journalists: "The Socialists are strong and work best when they address the country, not just themselves."
