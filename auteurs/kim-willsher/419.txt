It is the one of the biggest squares in On Sunday, Paris Socialist mayor Bertrand Delanoë, accompanied by the woman he hopes will succeed him in City Hall, Anne Hidalgo, unveiled the place's £20.4m facelift â £5m over-budget, and hailed a project that he said had reclaimed the place, previously a glorified roundabout, for the people. Around 70% of the 3.4 hectares making up the square and its surroundings roads have become a pedestrian zone.
"My predecessors handed the square over to the car. We wanted to put beauty, the values of the République, and a joie de vivre at the heart of this transformation," Delanoë said as he strolled around the square on Sunday morning shaking hands with people.
Watching young children playing in the new paddling pool and by the kiosk, where toys and games can be hired, the mayor added: "The greatest pleasure this morning is to see that the children of Paris have already taken ownership of the square."
Delanoë had made cleaning up the emblematic Place de la République, which sits at the crossroads of Paris' 3rd, 10th and 11th arrondissements in the north of the capital, part of his 2008 re-election campaign. Hidalgo has said if elected next year she will look at renovating two other symbolic sites, Place de la Nation and Place de la Bastille. The opposition centre-right UMP opposed the project and accused Delanoë of creating traffic chaos and being "anti-car".
The centrepiece of Place de la République is the 9.5 metre bronze statue of Marianne, the female symbol of the republic holding aloft an olive branch in her right hand and resting her left on a tablet engraved with Droits de l'homme. The statue, created by brothers Léopold and Charles Morice and installed in 1883, had been given a facelift, scrubbed clean of the graffiti tags and footprints left by protestors who have taken to climbing on it to hang their banners during demonstrations.
