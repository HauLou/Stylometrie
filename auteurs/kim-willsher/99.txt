Award-winning French novelist In 2022, with the help of the French Socialist party and the centrists, Mohammed Ben Abbes defeats the far-right Front National and takes up residence at the Elysée Palace. The country is in turmoil.
Soumission (Submission), which will be published in the new year, will confirm Houellebecqâs reputation as one of Franceâs most provocative writers.
Even the title has been described as provocative, suggesting a translation of the word âIslamâ, which in Arabic means submission to the will of Allah.
The narrator of the plot, described as a typical Houellebecq antihero, is a 44-year-old literary professor, who occasionally frequents prostitutes and is attracted by women half his age.
The novel suggests that despite record unpopularity, Franceâs Socialist president, François Hollande, clings on to power until 2022, but is eliminated in the first round of the presidential elections by a far-right Front National candidate and by Ben Abbes, representing the imaginary Muslim Fraternity party. With the support of the left, centre and the centre-right UMP party led by former president Nicolas Sarkozy, Abbes wins the election.
Les Inrockuptibles magazine said the plot âcompletely overturns societyâ.
Houellebecq, 56, whose real name is Michel Thomas, caused a row with his book Les Particules élémentaires (Atomised in English) in which he suggested the hippies of the May 1968 student movement had created the âserial killers of the 1990sâ.
In an 2001 interview with the review Lire he attacked Islam describing it as âthe most stupid religionâ.
âI say to myself that the fact of believing in a single god is the behaviour of a cretin, I canât find another word. And the stupidest religion is, letâs face it, Islam â¦ the Bible, at least, is beautiful because the Jews have a huge literary talent â¦ and for that they can be forgiven much.â
Afterwards, four Muslim organisations took legal action against him claiming he was âinsulting a group of people because of their religious beliefsâ and was âcomplicit in inciting racial hatredâ.
Houellebecq told the court he did not despise Muslims, but held contempt for their religion adding that like Christianity and Judaism it was based on âtexts of hateâ. The court dismissed the case against him.
Soumission is Houellebecqâs first novel since 2010 when he published La Carte et le Territoire (The Map and the Territory), which featured as its main character the âcelebrated novelist Michel Houllebecqâ. The novel won the Prix Goncourt, Franceâs top literary award.
Houllebecq is the most translated, and hence internationally renowned, of all Franceâs contemporary writers, but has been accused of racism, xenophobia and playing up to the media.
Soumission will be his sixth novel.
On Tuesday, Franceâs culture minister, Fleur Pellerin, told French radio she would certainly read it, adding that Houellebecq had always been a âprovocative novelistâ who had a âstrange sense of humour.â
France24 television said the 300-page book risked âinflaming passionsâ.âWe all know the writerâs taste for provocation and soundbite declarations,â it said.
In the 2011 Lire interview, Houellebecq, who admitted he was âalways on the side of the Jewsâ directed his bile not only at Islam but other âmonotheismsâ for which he said he felt a âtotal rejectionâ. In an interview in August he told French journalists he found âthe figure of Christ to be very unpleasantâ.
