On the front pages in newspaper kiosks near the opposition UMP party headquarters in Paris, there is a strange sense of deja vu. Ten years ago â on 28 November 2004 â a desperately ambitious politician by the name of Nobody believed the permanently agitated âSuper Sarkoâ, who dreamed constantly of being president â and not, as he famously claimed, âonly when Iâm shaving each morningâ â would sit still for long. They were right. Within three years he was in the Elysée Palace.
On Friday, a decade on and just two and a half years after he suffered a bruising defeat at the hands of François Hollande, Sarkozy is tipped to win the leadership vote of the UMPâs 268,000 card-carrying members and to slide once more into the same seat. Again, there is little doubt he intends to use it to make another bid to lead There are three candidates in Sundayâs election. But in the modern glass and white vinyl foyer of the party HQ on Friday it was an image of Sarkozy, in profile, gazing statesmanlike into the distance under the slogan âLa France Forteâ (Strong France) â a poster from his ill-fated 2012 presidential campaign â that greeted visitors.
Opinion polls give Sarkozy, 59, a convincing victory, with more than 60% of votes against 31% for former minister Bruno Le Maire, 45, and 5% for outsider Hervé Mariton, 56.
Political analyst Madani Cheurfa of CEVIPOF, the Sciences-Po political thinktank, says the key question is not whether he will win, but by how much. âHe hasnât had a good campaign and support dropped at the end. This will have important consequences for Nicolas Sarkozy because the weaker his score the weaker his position and room for manoeuvre,â Cheurfa said.
Mindful of the far-right Front National nibbling away at the UMPâs core support, Sarkozy fought a leadership campaign that occasionally lurched into Marine Le Penâs territory. Responding to catcalls from anti-gay marriage militants at one rally, he agreed, apparently on impulse, to repeal the same-sex marriage law introduced last year. He has also talked of stopping basic medical aid for migrants.
At another rally he explained he had appointed Rachida Dati, the daughter of north African migrants, as justice minister in 2012 because âwith an Algerian mother and a Moroccan father, it made sense she could talk about criminal policyâ.
âEveryone was rowing very hard to get back on track after that,â said one political insider, who did not want to be named.
It was, however, the sort of unguarded outburst for which Sarkozy is infamous. Who will ever forget his foul-mouthed outburst at the annual French agriculture show when he told one farmer âWhat has astonished a number of people in the UMP is that Nicolas Sarkozy has not changed. They were expecting him to have learned from past mistakes, to have lost the nervous tics and agitation and gained some presidential stature, but no,â added the insider.
Georges-Marc Benamou, engaged by Sarkozy in 2007 as an Elysée adviser, wrote in an account of his time at the heart of French power, Comédie Française, that the former leader had few political hang-ups about flirting with âextreme right themes â¦ public order, the ostracising of foreigners, the Roma, xenophobia â¦â
On Friday, the left-leaning daily Libération went further, accusing Sarkozy of running a campaign riddled with âfat and small liesâ. That a man dogged by political and legal scandals who has been put under official investigation in a corruption inquiry and who was deeply unpopular during his five-year term in office between 2007 and 2012 can make such a political comeback at all is one of the mysteries of French public life.
He is the favourite of UMP members for whom the election of a new leader is seen as a chance to rebuild the party after it imploded into squabbling after Sarkozyâs 2012 defeat. They have reportedly even taken to calling Sarkozy âJohnnyâ after the veteran rocker and much-loved national treasure Johnny Hallyday.
But wider polls suggest French voters currently prefer former prime minister Alain Juppé as the centre-right candidate for the 2017 presidential election.
In 2012, Sarkozy warned journalists on a trip to French Guiana that if he lost the election it was âa certaintyâ he would stop politics. âIâll change my life completely, and you wonât hear from me again,â he told them.
It was a decision reportedly welcomed by his wife, the former supermodel Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, who was more than happy to leave the Elysée and is now said to have a âcertain apprehensionâ about her husbandâs comeback.
âBeing at the Elysée is something very peculiar â¦ and for five years there was such media pressure on us all,â Jean Sarkozy, the second of Sarkozyâs four children from three marriages, told Le Nouvel Observateur. âAnd sharing close moments during the last two years has been such a pleasure.â
Madani Cheurfa said Sarkozyâs ability to bounce back from defeat was tied up with the almost monarchical âmythologyâ surrounding French presidents.
âThereâs this idea of the âman of destinyâ who sacrifices his whole life to public service and for whom an election loss is a political desert to be crossed,â Cheurfa said.
âIn truth, itâs more like fighting dogs: never mind whoâs right or wrong or who has the ideas, itâs the one who sinks their teeth in and doesnât let go who wins.â
