Will he â¦ won't he? Hours before François Hollande gives a key press conference â with reports of his alleged secret liaison with an actor still making headlines â the question was, would he mention the scandal, or would he make journalists drag it out of him?
The French president had intended to use the occasion to outline his employment and growth boosting policies for 2014 and announce, among other proposals, an easing of charges and regulations for businesses. It was also to be a statesmanlike attempt to haul his popularity off rock bottom.
Closer magazine scuppered that with its seven-page "special" of the president apparently visiting actor Julie Gayet in an apartment a stone's throw from the Elysée Palace on Friday. The magazine, which also published photos allegedly of Hollande on his way to the secret trysts on the back of a scooter, claimed the affair had been going on for some months.
Sections of the French media have feigned indifference to the Hollande "affair" and blamed prurient "Anglo-Saxon" press for the furore. Tuesday afternoon's press conference is expected to be attended by around 600 French and foreign journalists.
The event will also be overshadowed by concerns for the president's official partner, Valérie Trierweiler. The shock of the revelation and very public humiliation has left her in hospital with depression, according to reports. Hollande has not denied Closer's claims but says it is an outrageous and illegal invasion of privacy.
As friends of Trierweiler told journalists she was taking a few days to reflect on their relationship, sympathy was in short supply for her.
François Rebsamen, head of the Socialist group in the upper house, admitted it was a "terrible shock to see the life of the person with whom you live exposed and presented to the French in this way", but added the first lady title should be banned.
"There shouldn't be a first lady, it's finished," Rebsamen told RTL radio.
"There's a more important consideration that the president of the republic should have and that is over the role and position of the person with whom he lives.
"There is no first lady in He added: "It would be a step forward for democracy".
Trierweiler, 48, was taken to hospital on Friday suffering from what was described as "a severe case of the blues", hours after a French magazine published photographs of the president apparently paying secret visits to Gayet.
She was expected to be discharged on Monday, but her office announced she would remain in hospital because she was "still in need of a rest".
"She needs some peace," an Elysée spokesperson told Reuters.
Trierweiler has made no comment about the affair. Le Parisien on Monday reported she was ready to forgive Hollande, 59, but wanted to know "his intentions".
Le Parisien journalist Frédéric Gerschel, said to be close to Trierweiler, said Hollande had confessed to her face to face on Thursday evening, hours before Closer hit the news stands.
"The scene took place in the Elysée without blows or shouting. In a few words, the president acknowledged the existence of it [the affair]," Gerschel wrote.
"He denied nothing, not the escapades on his scooter with his bodyguard in the middle of the night, nor the frequency of the secret meetings, or the date when this 'love affair', as the foreign press has baptised it, started, several months previously," Gerschel wrote.
"After this explanation, that one imagines was delicate, the couple gave themselves a few days to reflect before clarifying the situation in the eyes of [public] opinion. This affair that should have remained private has quickly spilled out into the public domain. It's a veritable political-romantic tsunami."
Le Parisien quoted a friend as saying Hollande's confession of infidelity had struck Trierweiler "like a TGV hitting the buffers", adding: "Of course she'd heard the rumours that have been going around Tuesday's press conference is the third since Hollande took power in 2012. He may divert attempts to hijack the press conference with questions about the scandal, by referring to it in his traditional opening address, then refusing to comment further.
Advisers argue that the French are more interested in serious issues including the economy and employment.
Le Figaro said it was essential for Hollande to address public spending, fiscal reform, schemes to reduce unemployment and the conflict in the Central African Republic, where France has 1,600 troops.
