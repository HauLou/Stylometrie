On the other hand her British fans, who remember her as the pixie-faced heroine of The Fabulous Destiny of Amélie Poulain, one of the most successful French films of all time, can look forward to a feast after the famine.
Next month the film Around the same time, Tautou will confront her instinct to run away from the limelight, having agreed to be Such an honour suggests Tautou has finally made it on to the list of French cinema's national treasures, headed by Thierry Chèze of the monthly movie magazine "There was a section of the French media that just didn't understand how or why In the 12 years since As the American critic Anthony Lane wrote in his Playing Tom Hanks's sidekick in the populist but hugely successful The Da Vinci Code did little to soften critical hard-hearts in France.
On learning that Tautou, 36, had been chosen to open and close the Cannes Film Festival, the centre-left However, it added waspishly: "In accepting the role as No wonder Tautou has long held an ambivalent attitude towards her chosen career.
She grew up in rural Auvergne in south-central France and decided she liked acting after her father, a dental surgeon, and mother, a teacher â who named her after Audrey Hepburn â sent her on a summer course at the renowned Cours Florent theatre school in Paris as a reward for passing her baccalaureate with honours.
The young Tautou, however, was more interested in painting and drawing, subjects her parents doubted would lead to gainful employment.
Instead she was encouraged to study literature at the Sorbonne. After graduating, she considered a career studying primates, but gave herself one year "and not a day more" to make it as an actress. "I thought, 'I don't want to keep doing this job, if this job doesn't want me'. I didn't want to spend all my life waiting for the phone to ring and living in a 10 square metres apartment. No, no, no. There are too many other wonderful things to do in life," she once said.
In that year she was cast in the gentle comedy The movie caught the eye of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who was looking for someone to play Amélie after his first choice, the British actress Emily Watson, suddenly became unavailable.
Roles followed in Stephen Frears's Dirty Pretty Things, Coco Before Chanel and Beautiful Lies, directed by Pierre Salvadori, with whom Tautou worked in the 2006 comedy None of the roles, nor her appointment as the face of Chanel No 5, appears to have done much to boost her confidence or make her less of a shrinking violet. In a 2011 interview she said: "A few months ago, I watched one of my old movies and I thought to myself, 'Oh, Jesus!' Thank God that at the point I made that film I didn't realise the extent to which I was terrible. Oh, mon dieu!
"I say to myself, does it simply mean that if in another 10 years I re-watch the films I am making today I will say, 'Oh mon dieu, how terrible I was then'."
After With French reviewers were less effusive than English-speaking critics like Ed Gibbs of the The French were kinder to her than they had been for a long time. Even The César never came, but Tautou told She added: "What I have in common with her is being quite obedient, even if I admire rebels. Thérèse sees things around her with a lot of distance, she analyses all the familiar conventions, that hypocrisy, the hidden violence that is omnipresent. I understood her so well that it wasn't hard to play her."
Chèze said that presenting Cannes will be much more of a challenge for the actress. "It won't be an easy exercise for Audrey, as she's discreet and introverted by nature. She won't like it, but I think she said yes because, after all, everyone has to confront their fears and there's (Steven) Spielberg heading the jury this year, so it's a huge honour."
He added: "She will probably always be remembered as Amélie; it's just one of those things. And whatever people thought of the film, it made Audrey an international star."
