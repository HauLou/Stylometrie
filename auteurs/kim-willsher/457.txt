They are Hollywood's most famous couple, but Brad Pitt and In fact the organic Miraval rosé 2012, produced from the high-profile pair's French vineyard is not only remarkably discreet, but relatively inexpensive.
The first 6,000 bottles, with a black, white and gold label, went on sale on the internet on Thursday for â¬105 (£91) a case, including shipping for delivery in For that price, it might have been dismissed as cheap plonk, but one French critic praised the wine â produced from grenache, syrah and cinsault grapes grown in the Var region of south-eastern France â for its "dynamism" and "expressive fruit".
Thierry Desseauve, said in the often impenetrable language of wine critics, that it boasted "energy, dynamism, with persistence and freshness".
The grapes were grown on the 40-hectare (100-acre) Miraval estate owned by the A-list couple since 2008. Pitt and Jolie joined forces with the Perrin family of vintners to create and market a total of 100,000 bottles that will be sold to independent wine stores and restaurants.
The rosé debut will be followed by red and white wines.
"With this 2012 rosé, Miraval reveals the extraordinary potential of wines from Provence. This unique terroir naturally expresses itself in the aromatic wine with a round mouth feel that is full of freshness," read a statement from the Perrin family.
If the couple wanted to keep a low profile, they succeeded; the only mention of the stars is on the label at the back which reads: "Bottled by Jolie-Pitt and Perrin."
