 The French president, François Hollande, has described revelations that the US spied on three successive French presidents as unacceptable and said Paris would not tolerate actions that threaten its security.
The US ambassador was summoned to the foreign ministry for an explanation after WikiLeaks documents published late on Tuesday showed that the US had bugged French leadersâ telephones. 
But Hollandeâs government faces accusations of hypocrisy, with MPs due to vote through a law later on Wednesday that would give intelligence agencies sweeping new powers to snoop on French people.
The bill allows phone and email intercepts without the approval of a judge, seen by critics as a serious threat to individual freedom and privacy. The French authorities argue the measures are necessary following the attacks on the offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine and a Kosher supermarket in January. 
It was not clear whether the timing of the A statement after the crisis summit, described by Franceâs prime minister, Manuel Valls, as being âfull of emotion and angerâ, blasted US snooping as unacceptable and demanded it stop.
âFrance will not tolerate actions that threaten its security and the protection of its interests,â the French presidentâs office said, adding that US spying allegations had surfaced in the past.
âThese are unacceptable facts that have already been the subject of clarification between the US and  Hollandeâs office said the French president had phoned Obama on Wednesday afternoon. âThe exchange was a chance to emphasise the principles that must govern relations between allies in matters of intelligence,â said Hollandeâs office. âPresident Obama clearly reiterated the firm pledge he made in November 2013, after the Snowden affair, and which was repeated during the state visit [by Hollande] in February 2014, to end practices that might have operated in the past but which are unacceptable between allies.
âFrench intelligence officials will very soon travel to Washington to increase cooperation.â
The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, summoned the US ambassador, Jane Hartley, to the foreign office. And government spokesman Stéphane Le Foll announced a senior French intelligence official would visit the US in the coming days for further discussions with American counterparts.âWe find it hard to understand or imagine what motivates an ally to spy on allies who are often on the same strategic positions in world affairs,â Le Foll added.
The revelations were first reported in French daily Libération and on news website Mediapart, which said the Hollande held a second crisis meeting with parliamentary groups at his Élysée Palace offices on Wednesday afternoon. Afterwards, Valls told MPs the âsystematic and continuedâ spying on foreign leaders by America was âunacceptable and abnormalâ. Valls said he could reassure MPs that France did not eavesdrop on the leaders of European and allied countries.
âOur country is loyal and knows the historical debt it owes America, but this gratitude cannot prevent us from protecting our country and citizens,â he said.
The leaked US documents, marked top secret, were based on phone taps and filed in an NSA document labelled âEspionnage Élyséeâ (Élysée spy), according to Libération and Mediapart.

The recorded conversations, which were handled by the summary services unit at the NSA, were said to reveal few state secrets but show clear evidence of the extent of American spying on countries considered allies. WikiLeaks documents suggest that other US spy targets included French cabinet ministers and the French ambassador to the US.
âThe documents contain the âselectorsâ from the target list, detailing the cell phone numbers of numerous officials in the Élysée up to and including the direct cell phone of the president,â a report of the taps published in the French media revealed.
In an article co-authored by Julian Assange, the French newspaper Libération pointed out that in matters of spying, there are no friends. It said: âSpying abroad is the ultimate âgrey zoneâ in surveillance â it is also, in France, the real blind spot of the planned law on surveillance, expected to be adopted this Wednesday.â
Mediapart said: âFor almost 10 years, the United States has listened in to French presidents â¦ it was all classed top secret or âspecial intelligenceâ.
US media cited a statement from the NSA saying it was not targeting and would not target Hollandeâs communications. The statement did not deny spying had taken place in the past.
Le Point magazine pointed out that France spends about â¬1bn (£700m) a year on its secret and intelligence services, compared with â¬60bn the US spends. It said this illustrated a âdifference of means, but not of methodsâ and said the WikiLeaks revelations were nothing new.
âThe secret and intelligence services have always had the role of discovering and sending to political leaders, diplomats and military personnel information allowing them to make their decisions,â it wrote. âThe brutal fact is, being allies over one thing doesnât mean we share everything or hold back on spying on our little friend.â
Bernard Debré, a member of Sarkozyâs opposition Republican party, went further, writing on his blog: âPoliticians are astonished to have been spied on by the Americans! Itâs a bloody hypocrisy. For years everyone has been listened in on by the NSA, the NSA has been accused by senators and governors and has drastically reduced its activity â¦ and at the same time, France is going in the opposite direction.â
Arnaud Danjean, a former member of Franceâs intelligence service, the DGSE, and now a Euro MP for the Republican party, said there was nothing new in the revelations.
âItâs all very emotional, but on a technical and geopolitical level thereâs nothing new in reporting that spies are spying. Being an ally doesnât mean that you tell each other everything,â Danjean told France Info.
âWhen one is a diplomat, one knows one is a target. When youâre someone in the public sphere, you start from the principle that foreign countries are interested in you, you take defensive measures as a result.â
