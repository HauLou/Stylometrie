A splinter group that claims links to the militant group Gourdel was reportedly snatched while walking in the mountainous region of Kabylie, near the capital, Algiers. The French government said it was not clear whether the man had been kidnapped by bandits or Islamic fundamentalists.
In the video, the man said he was being held by the âSoldiers of the Caliphateâ, a group affiliated to Isis. The kidnappers said they would kill him unless France ended its involvement in the coalition against Isis. Last week The hostage was filmed sitting between two armed and masked men. He delivered a short message to Franceâs president, François Hollande. âThis armed group has asked me to demand that you do not intervene in Iraq. They are holding me hostage. I beg you, Monsieur Président, to do all in your power to get me out of here,â he said.
Gourdel, reported to be a mountain guide from Nice, was said to have arrived a few days before on a tourist visa. He had rented a chalet at Tikjda, 75 miles (120km) east of the capital, with Algerian friends. He was hiking with two others and had spent the night at a ski lodge near Tikjda.
âEverything is being done to find our compatriot. All our services are being mobilised to that end, and no theory is ruled out. We are in constant contact with the Algerian authorities, who are cooperating and supporting our inquiry,â said the French foreign ministry.
Hours before the kidnapping, Isis called on its supporters to kill civilians, namely Americans, French, and âtheir alliesâ.
Since 2005, about 80 Algerians have been kidnapped in Kabylie by groups demanding a ransom. Most of those who were abducted for extortion were later freed by Algerian security forces.
Franceâs interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said: âFrance isnât afraid [of Isis], because itâs not the first time weâve been threatened, and we are prepared to respond to their threats. Even if there is no such thing as a zero risk, weâre taking 100% precautions. The government will take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of its citizens.
âThis threat to kill civilians, added to the execution of hostages and to the massacres, is yet another demonstration of the barbarity of these terrorists, justifying our fight without truce or pause.â
