History has shown that when it comes to French-British rivalry and cross-Channel spats, few subjects are off limits. The euro, agricultural policy, European subsidies, Margaret Thatcher, football, the Olympics â all have the ability to spark a war of words between the two nations, whose love-hate relationship has smouldered for centuries.
So as French bookshops prepare to take stock of the British bestseller In fact our neighbours are deeply unimpressed with the so-called "mummy porn", or, as the French have translated the term, It is perhaps not surprising that the country that spawned what one magazine called "the heavyweights of erotic literature" â the Marquis de Sade and the Story of O, coincidentally republished this week â should be sniffy about a mere bestseller of 40m copies in 46 countries.
But the critical mauling the British book has received is brutal. Les Inrocks magazine asked if it marked a "cultural shock between the Anglo-Saxon hypocrisy and the old authentic SM of the French". It described James's offering as "sadomasochism light â¦ and flavourless", full of "insignificant, consensual and cliched" content and the "fantasies of a cheap sex-shop". James's book, it said, contained none of the "philosophy" of the relationship between master and slave.
Fifty Shades of Grey, the first novel in the trilogy, recounts the meeting of Anastasia Steele and her submission to and obsessive love for Christian Grey, a handsome billionaire with a predilection for bondage and domination. It became the fastest-selling paperback since records started and is the first ebook to have sold more than 1m copies. In a television interview the author Erika Leonard said the book was her "midlife crisis writ large".
But many French critics have dismissed the trilogy as "Mills & Boon", and without any literary merit. Le Figaro carried an article on the "20 most ridiculous quotes from" Fifty Shades of Grey. To emphasise its lack of literary credentials, it also published the cover next to 50 letters from the Marquis de Sade to his wife.
Sade, a French aristocrat and libertine from whose name the words "sadist" and "sadism" dervive, combined philosophical ramblings with often violent and pornographic sexual fantasies in his works, many of which were written in prison. His sexual morality has both repelled and fascinated the French since his death in 1814.
The literary prize-winning 1954 novel Story of O, written by Anne Desclos under the pseudonym Pauline Réage, tells the story of a beautiful Parisian fashion photographer being blindfolded, whipped, chained, branded and pierced and who willingly becomes a slave to her lover, René.
Fifty Shades of Grey's Paris publisher, JC Lattès, has ordered one of the biggest print runs of any French publishing house this year. Isabelle Laffont, managing director of JC Lattès, said the firm had originally envisaged a run of 350,000 copies, but had increased this to 500,000 after a flood of orders. "We have been pleasantly surprised by the way the book has been received," she said.
"Everyone says it's not literature, which is true, but we are promoting it as the story of love like you have never read before. For the first time this is a book that is erotic but also about love. Previous books have had the eroticism but have been rather brutal, but this is a love story.
"It's a bit hot in places, but it's not perverse and the heroine is not a victim."
The Nouvel Obs, however, decried the book as "sexual frolics, knitted within an improbable love story, a thin plot and repetitive writing".
"Never mind," it wrote. "A film is being made in Hollywood and EL James, who up until now has never written a book, has become a millionaire."
The website Slate.fr added: "In Fifty Shades there is no intellectual construction; this is the glaring difference with Sade, and with the Story of O. Nor will you find that poetic eroticism that makes Anais Nin's books so charming. It's 50 shades of boredom."
