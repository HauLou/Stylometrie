The French prime minister resigned on Monday after President François Hollande and his Socialist government suffered a crushing defeat in local elections.
Jean-Marc Ayrault, who had led the French cabinet since the left came to power in 2012, announced he would go after a day of feverish speculation over a ministerial reshuffle. The announcement, confirmed by Ayrault's office at Matignon, came two hours before Hollande was due to make a televised announcement.
Speaking for the first time since the election rout on Sunday, the president said: "It's an important moment in our national life. You have expressed your unhappiness and disappointment. I have heard your message â it's clear. Not enough change, not enough jobs, too much unemployment, too many taxes â¦ and the question about our ability to address these problems. I have taken this message personally. I will respond with honesty and clarity â¦
"Jean-Marc Ayrault has made reforms that are an honour to him. I am grateful to him. I have given Valls' blunt speaking and naked ambition have led to him being compared to former president Nicolas Sarkozy. Known as France's After Black Sunday it was a Grey Monday as Hollande struggled to limit the unprecedented damage to his leadership and administration following the elections, amid calls from the jubilant opposition for "power-sharing".
The deeply unpopular president had been urged by members of his own party and the opposition centre-right UMP to act swiftly and decisively in response to what was seen as a vote of no confidence in his government.
In the event, he kept the country guessing frenzy over which cabinet minsters' heads would fall, as key members of his administration were summoned to the Elysée Palace. Ayrault, the first casualty of the Socialists' poor showing at the polls, spent two hours with the president on Monday morning discussing the "consequences of the defeat" in the municipal elections. Ayrault was reported to have wanted to resign on Sunday after it became clear the party had been given a drubbing in the second-round vote, but was talked out of it by colleagues.
As the day wore on, Hollande's indecisiveness looked dangerously like living up to his former reputation as Monsieur Flanby â after a wobbly French pudding. The lack of any information from the Elysée sparked feverish speculation that veered from the unusual â the possible return of the president's former partner Ségolène Royal â to the desperate â the summoning of disgraced former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn to save the day.
When an announcement was finally made, it was that Hollande would make a statement to be broadcast on television.
Le Monde newspaper said it was essential Hollande showed he was "not deaf" to the election defeat that saw the Socialist party lose about 150 big towns, mostly to the opposition right.
There were also significant and historic gains for the far-right Front National, which took control in municipalities and gained more than 1,200 seats on local councils. The abstention rate of 38.5% of the electorate went against the Socialists.
The only moment of relief for Hollande came when it was confirmed that the Socialist candidate Anne Hidalgo had won in Paris, making her the capital's first female mayor. She will succeed the popular Socialist mayor Bertrand Delanoê, her mentor, who has run the city since 2001.
Marine Le Pen, president of the FN, who has softened the image of the anti-immigration, nationalistic party founded by her father, Jean-Marie, claims the far right is now the third force in French politics and growing. Le Pen is hoping to repeat the party's success in European elections in May, and polls suggest she has a good chance.
Madani Cheurfa, a political analyst at CEVIPOF, said the FN result was more than a protest vote. "There is always a part of the FN vote that is an expression of defiance, but we see in this election that there has been a vote of support for the FN. In a recent survey we did, 60% of those asked said they had no confidence in the left or the right. The FN has said 'try us' and the voters have."
Cheurfa said the FN could do well in the European elections, which have a traditionally high rate of abstention, but said the real test of whether the far right had made permanent inroads into the France's political landscape would not be known until the 2017 legislative elections.
There was no shortage of bad news for Hollande's Socialists. Official figures showed A few hours later, Yamina Benguigui, the minister for the French-speaking world, who was elected as a Paris councillor on Sunday, was accused of lying on her declaration of assets. Benguigui is alleged to have hid shares worth â¬430,000 (£355,000) held in Belgium. She denied the claims. One of Hidalgo's first decisions as mayor was to demand Benguigui's resignation.

Manuel Valls, 51, was born in Barcelona, Spain, the son of a Catalan painter and a Swiss Italian mother. Valls joined the Socialist party at the age of 17 and took French nationality three years later. He speaks four languages and has four children by his first wife. In 2010 he married violinist Anne Gravoin. He was a rival of Hollande for the Socialist party's presidential nomination in 2011, but later become the president's campaign spokesman. Classed as belonging to the right wing of the PS, he is an adept of social democracy à la Germany and Scandinavia.
In the past he has described himself as a "Blairiste" (after Tony Blair) and a "Clintonien" (after Bill Clinton). Unlike colleagues who talk of social solidarity and collectivity, Valls talks of "economic realism" and "individual responsibility".
