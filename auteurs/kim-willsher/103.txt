The last French hostage being held by Islamic extremists has been freed, President François Hollande announced on Tuesday.
Serge Lazarevic had been held by al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb for more than three years. He was released near Kidal, in the north of In a statement, the Elysée Palace said Lazarevic was in âreasonably good health despite the terrible conditions of his captivityâ. He was said to be en route to the Niger capital, Niamey, from where he would be flown to Manuel Valls, the French prime minister, wrote on Twitter: âA long ordeal has come to an end, a life can go on. Immense relief for Serge Lazarevic.â
The French government refused to give any details about the conditions for Lazarevicâs release, saying only that it was the result of âintense effortsâ by Niger and Mali.
David Thomson, a journalist for the French international radio station RFI and a specialist in Islamist groups, told Le Monde it was probable that a ransom had been paid and an exchange of prisoners agreed for the hostageâs release.
Lazarevic, who holds French and Serbian nationality, was kidnapped along with a second Frenchman, Philippe Verdon, whom he was accompanying on a business trip, in northern Mali in November 2011. A group of armed men burst into their hotel rooms and snatched them, claiming they were working for French intelligence services. Verdon was found dead in July 2013 having been shot in the head.
