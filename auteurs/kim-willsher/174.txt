Sited at the heart of France's main business district at La Défense, the enormous and impressive Grande Arche was always more than a monument to the triumph of humanitarian ideals over military glory.
The 20th century version of the Arc de Triomphe â a marble and glass cube measuring 110m high by 110m wide and 110m deep and big enough to fit Notre Dame cathedral in its archway â stood as a totem to French economic clout.
It dominated the skyline, gave magnificent views over the capital and, at its triumphal inauguration on Bastille Day 1989, was said to even have managed to entrap Margaret Thatcher in its lavatories (her security guards had to smash the door after the handle came off inside).
What better symbolism for French grandeur in an area whose ambition was â and still is â to rival the City of London? How the tourist guides delighted in the anecdote.
A quarter of a century on, however, the crumbling state of La Grande Arche de la Défense might be a metaphor for France's struggling economy.
The roof â with its viewing platform, gastronomic restaurant, computer museum and conference centre, which attracted around 250,000 people a year â has been closed to the public for four years, amid safety concerns. The area around the foot of the north side of the arch has been sealed off after fears of crumbling marble falling on people below, and staff of the French ecology and housing ministries, who occupy the south side, have complained of gloomy corridors and offices with oppressively low ceilings and no natural light.
The government has now promised â¬200m (£160m) worth of "important renovation work" on the south side of the arch to begin in October and last for two years.
The Grande Arche was designed by Danish architect Johann Otto von Spreckelsen, who won an international competition to design a 20th century Arc de Triomphe but who was later forced through illness to transfer responsibility for the construction to French architect Paul Andreu.
The building's concrete frame, with 30m-deep foundations, is covered with 300,000 tonnes of glass and Italian Carrara marble.
A series of security studies carried out between 2004 and 2010 raised concerns about the state of the structure and suggested that the arch was not wearing well. One in six of its marble tiles was crumbling because the porosity of the stone made it vulnerable to the weather and pollution.
The roof was closed to the public after a lift accident in April 2010, even though no one was injured, and shortly afterwards the marble slabs on the southern tower were replaced by harder wearing granite.
Andreu admitted the day-to-day conditions for workers inside the arch were particularly hard.
"We were under heavy constraints in constructing a 'modern Arc de Triomphe' that continued the historic east-west axis in Paris. The exterior appearance was given priority over the interior. Today, we need to completely reorganise the building," Andreu told Agence France-Presse.
The north side, owned by the insurance group Axa and the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations (a state owned financial organisation), is more problematic, say officials. Out of 30,000 sq m of offices, 24,000 sq m are empty and rents have fallen.
Michel-Régis Talon, spokesperson for the ecology ministry, said no decision had been taken over the roof with its superb views.
"We have never given up hope of reopening it," he said.
