The honorary president of Franceâs Front National party said he would step down as a candidate in regional elections later this year, but also had a dig at his daughter Marine with the suggestion that his granddaughter Marion Maréchal should replace him.
Relations between father and daughter degenerated into a public spat last week after Le Pen Sr, 86, reiterated his assertion that the Holocaust was a âmere detailâ in the history of the second world war, and lauded the Vichy government that collaborated with the Nazis, among other provocative statements.
In an interview with the centre-right Le Figaro newspaper on Monday, Le Pen, who had threatened to leave the political ring âonly at the end of the bout, whether victor or vanquishedâ, seemed almost conciliatory as he said he would withdraw his candidature to avoid further damage to the party.
âI still think I am the best candidate for the Front National, but if I have to sacrifice this for the future of the party I will not be the one who will cause the damage,â he said.However, in a defiant statement a few hours later the former paratrooper was back on characteristically provocative and pugilistic form.He stated he would prefer to be âbeaten because of my ideas, than elected on those of my rivalsâ, a clear dig at Marine, who he has accused of selling out to the system, adding: âI have not changed!â.He pointed out that having founded the FN and âled it during a period of 40 years of constant adversityâ he considered himself a good âlocomotiveâ to head the local regional election campaign.
His controversial interviews did not justify the âracket sparked in our ranks that risks dangerously weakening our movementâ, he declared, adding: âI will not be an accomplice to that manoeuvre ... Thatâs why I have decided not to be a candidate for the regional elections.â
Marine Le Pen had last week lambasted her fatherâs strategy as âsomewhere between scorched earth and political suicideâ. She said: âHis status as honorary president does not give him the right to hijack the Front National with vulgar provocations seemingly designed to damage me, but that unfortunately hit the whole movement.â
In Le Figaro on Monday, Le Pen Sr suggested his granddaughter Marion Maréchal-Le Pen, 25, would be an excellent choice to replace him. âIf she accepts I think she will a very effective head of list. Certainly, the best, I wonât say after me, but all the same â¦ âHe reiterated the call in his statement, urging party members to support Maréchal-Le Pen who became the republicâs youngest ever MP in 2012.
His public anointment of his granddaughter was seen as another swipe at his daughter. Maréchal-Le Pen, a rising star in the FN who is seen to hold more conservative views similar to her grandfatherâs, has refused to follow her aunt and criticise him.
French media reported on Monday that Maréchal-Le Pen had agreed to lead the FNâs PACA campaign after a weekend meeting with her grandfather. However, a few hours later, Bruno Gollnisch, one of Le Penâs oldest and closest friends announced he would also seek nomination to lead the FNâs list.
The final decision will be made at a party meeting on Friday.
Jean-Marie Le Pen faces a party disciplinary hearing later this month, but warned on Monday he would not go quietly. âFor as long as God gives me life, I will remain in my place at the battle stations,â he wrote.
