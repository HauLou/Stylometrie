Nicolas Sarkozy's claims that his legal woes were due to a leftwing conspiracy of magistrates and police overseen by the Socialist government have won little sympathy in The former president was charged with three counts of corruption after police questioned him for 15 hours. Sarkozy â who faces up to 10 years in prison and a â¬1m (£584,000) fine if he is convicted â denies any wrongdoing and claims he is a victim of "political interference" in the legal system.
In a television appearance on Wednesday night â his first since leaving the Elysée Palace in 2012 â Sarkozy claimed the justice system was being used as a "political instrument" against him.
The Socialist government vehemently denied his allegation. "The judiciary is independent," government spokesman Stéphane Le Foll told And Jean-Christophe Cambadélis, the leader of the Socialist party, said by accusing the judiciary of bias Sarkozy "is trying to divert public attention to politics, conspiracy theories or who knows what".
After being charged, Sarkozy was allowed to return home to his wife, Carla Bruni, the former supermodel turned singer, and their two-year-old daughter, Giulia.
Polls suggested the public and the press were sceptical of his claims of a sinister cabal plotting against him. Le Figaro, which has traditionally supported Sarkozy, 59, questioned whether the magistrates in the case were engaged in a "personal battle" and suggested public opinion felt the left in power was seeking revenge and "had not stopped harassing Nicolas Sarkozy".
But a poll for Le Parisien suggested otherwise. Carried out before Sarkozy's TV interview, but while elements of his counter-attack had leaked to the press, the poll showed that 63% of people believed the former president was not unfairly targeted and was being "treated like any other suspect".
A majority, 59%, said they did not want him to make a political comeback - 15% more than three months ago. Former prime minister Alain Juppé, 68 â who was given an 18-month suspended sentence in 2004 for his part in a party-funding scandal â was a more popular choice to become the opposition UMP's 2017 presidential candidate.
A second opinion poll, also carried out just before Sarkozy's television appearance, suggested 65% of people did not want Sarkozy back in power.

The idea that he is being "hounded" was supported by members of his centre-right party, where 80% felt he was being particularly harshly treated.
French media agreed that Sarkozy was far from beaten and had launched a feisty "counter attack" during his television interview. But Le Monde argues that the legal cases engulfing Sarkozy showed he had believed himself "untouchable'. "Each one of these episodes, and these are only the main ones, shows that for the players and their leader in particular, the end justifies all the means, that the protection afforded by the former president allowed them â him and those close to him â to believe they were untouchable, above the laws. 'Legal, even political, manoeuvring,' they cry as one. But they forget that to be the representative of of a country, or to hope to become one again, requires an unquestionably exemplary record," it wrote.
The left-leaning daily Libération was equally sceptical of an alleged plot. "Nobody can seriously believe that a host of judges and police got together in a secret operation organised by the Elysée Palace or elsewhere, with the aim of discrediting him (Sarkozy). On the contrary, it is an independent judiciary that is today confronting the former president," it wrote.
Meanwhile, However, she said, she believed the legal cases had scuppered the former president's hopes of a comeback: "Sarkozy is discredited from coming back into the contest, particularly the presidential contest."
Sarkozy's youngest son Louis, 17, who is attending a military school in the US, joined in the clamour â supporting his father with a series of tweets suggesting the legal case was part of a "relentless" plan to make sure he "doesn't return to politics" and that he was the only person who could save France. "Look at the state of our country, we're in the shit," one post read.
