One of the survivors of the Sigolène Vinson, a writer at the satirical magazine, described how she hid as Kalashnikov-toting brothers Chérif and Saïd Kouachi picked off colleagues one by one. Eleven people at the magazine died and a police officer was murdered as the gunmen fled.
Vinson said she had been in the kitchen making a coffee when the Kouachi brothers burst into the editorial meeting.
âWe heard two pops â¦ we all wondered what it was,â Vinson told Le Monde newspaper.
She said Franck Brinsolaro, a police protection officer assigned to Charlie Hebdo editor Stéphane âCharbâ Charbonnier, got up and appeared to be reaching for his pistol.
âHe said âDonât moveâ. I threw myself on the ground â¦ I knew it wasnât firecrackers.â
Vinson crawled towards some offices when the door of the editorial office burst open and a man cried: âAllahu akbar â¦ where is Charb?â
âI heard gunfire. I didnât look back, I didnât want to stare death in the face and I was sure I was going to die,â she said.
She joined other staff hiding in a colleagueâs office where they could hear but not see the killing spree.
âThey didnât fire in bursts, they shot one bullet after another. Slowly. Nobody shouted. Everyone must have been taken completely by surprise,â Vinson said.
Vinson heard footsteps and more gunfire. One of the gunmen, later identified as Saïd Kouachi, looked around an office wall and took aim.
âI looked at him. He had big dark eyes, a gentle look. I felt he was slightly troubled, like he was searching for my name,â she said.
âHe said âdonât be afraid, calm down. I wonât kill you. Youâre a woman, we donât kill women. But think about what you do, what you do is bad. Iâm sparing you and because Iâve spared you, you will read the Qurâanâ.
âI thought it quite cruel of him to ask me not to be afraid when heâd just killed everyone and was aiming at me with his gun. I thought it unfair to say that what weâd done was wrong, when good was on our side.
âI nodded my head, to maintain some kind of contact. I didnât want to lose eye contact because Jean-Luc [layout editor] was under the table â¦ I fully understood that if this guy didnât kill women, he killed men.â
She said Saïd Kouachi turned towards the editorial room where his brother Chérif had shot Elsa Cayat, another Charlie writer, and shouted: âWe donât kill women,â three times. The men then left.
Vinson described the scene of horror next door. She stepped over colleaguesâ bodies to reach her mobile phone in her coat pocket and called the emergency services.
âItâs Charlie, come quickly. They are all dead â¦ theyâre all dead,â she told them.
