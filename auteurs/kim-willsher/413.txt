The value of gems and watches stolen in a daring daylight raid on a diamond exhibition in Cannes was revised to â¬103m (£89m) on Monday, making it one of the world's largest jewel thefts.
A lone robber wearing gloves, a cap, and a scarf to mask his face made off with the haul after strolling into the luxury Carlton Hotel in the French Riviera town of Cannes just before lunchtime on Sunday.
Philippe Vique, an assistant prosecutor in the nearby town of Grasse, said the man had walked into a temporary exhibition of diamonds in the hotel through french doors that led on Cannes' famous Croisette. He pulled out a handgun and threatened the three private security guards, two sales staff and manager present. Then he filled his suitcase with gems, jewellery and diamond-encrusted watches and walked out. Although the man was seen making his escape on foot, police believe an accomplice was waiting nearby with a getaway vehicle.
"He took a bag and a small box and then fled by another French door on the inside (of the hotel)," Vique said. "He left on foot â¦ it was very fast."
The exhibition, called Extraordinary Diamonds, was organised by the diamond house Leviev, known for the quality of its stones.
Police first reported the haul to have been worth an estimated â¬40m, but an inventory of the stolen goods revealed it is worth more.
