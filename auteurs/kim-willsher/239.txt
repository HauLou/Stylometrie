François Hollande met rival German and US bidders for Alstom, one of France's biggest industrial groups, on Monday amid concerns that it could fall into American hands.
At a hastily called meeting at the Elysée Palace, the French president talked to representatives from General Electric and Munich-based Siemens and Hours before Monday's meeting, several government ministers were summoned by Hollande to discuss the future of the company. The French state sold its interest in Alstom in 2006 and has little power to intervene directly, but Hollande and his ministers have made it clear they prefer a European rather than US solution to Alstom's difficulties, and expect to be closely consulted about the its future.
The discussions centre on whether Siemens will relinquish its transport arm to Alstom in return for the French company handing over its energy division, to create what one The French government stepped in last week after it emerged that talks between Alstom and GE were already at an advanced stage. The US company had offered around â¬10bn (£8.2bn) for Alstom's energy unit, which accounts for 70% of group revenues and whose products include coal-powered turbines.
Hollande said on Monday night that the French state had an interest in what happened to Alstom, "because the state places orders [for] a certain number of purchases in sectors that are strategic, namely energy. That's the reason the state uses its position and why everyone understands this â¦ and so that the offers are improved regarding jobs and activities carried out in Speaking to a gathering of local administrative chiefs, he said: "Those who thought that it would be the market that determined my choices, that it would be solely private individuals who might use agreements and contracts to override the general interest, were wrong.
"The French are very attached to their state, and they want an efficient state."
The economy minister, Arnaud Montebourg, who had warned of "patriotic" concerns over a GE deal last week, told France's RTL radio on Monday he would not accept that "in three days, Alstom can decide to sell â¦ a national jewel behind the backs of the employees, the government, most of the board and senior executives".
Describing the situation as unacceptable, Montebourg said: "French firms are not prey. However, we are prepared to make alliances enabling us to face global competition. In the last few days we have taken several initiatives, the first being to reject a fait accompli."
Around three-quarters of Alstom's portfolio is in the energy sector â the company also makes steam turbines for nuclear power plants â and it employs 93,000 people around the world, including 18,000 in France.
Following the French government's obvious disquiet over GE's offer, Siemens wrote to Alstom's management at the weekend saying it was ready "to discuss future strategic opportunities".
Siemens had expressed an interest in its rival Alstom's energy holdings in 2004 â around the time the French government ordered a bailout to save the group and it shed its shipbuilding interests â but its advances were rebuffed. Two years later the government sold its stake in the company. In spite of intense pressure from the government, Patrick Kron, Alstom's chief executive, is opposed to any partnership or takeover by the German company.
Following Siemens' counter-offensive, Alstom announced that dealing in its shares on the French stock exchange would be suspended for two days of "strategic reflection". A decision is expected on Wednesday. It said in a statement: "Alstom is continuing and deepening its strategic reflection and will inform the market some time before the morning of Wednesday 30 April. As a result, the company has asked that trading in its shares remains suspended."
Hollande met the head of GE, Jeff Immelt, on Monday morning and was scheduled to meet the president of Siemens, Joe Kaeser, later. Martin Bouygues, Alstom's main shareholder with a 29.4% stake in the company, was due for talks at the Elysée on Monday evening.
After the meeting Immelt issued a statement saying: "The talks were open, friendly and productive â¦ it was important to hear in person President Hollande's point of view and to discuss our plans. We have agreed to work together."
The economist Nicolas Bouzou said the government's only weapon was verbal pressure, and said he feared the French state's bullish approach to GE would have the opposite effect to that desired.
He told the newspaper Le Parisien: "The state's position is legitimate, given that the government wants to protect a company that is in the strategic sectors of transport and energy, but acting for the sake of public opinion is no good. Some back room diplomacy would be better."
Montebourg told Le Monde: "Alstom is a symbol of France's industrial power and our ingenuity. The government is concerned and urges patriotic vigilance."
