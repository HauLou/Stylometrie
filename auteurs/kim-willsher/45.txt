The heir to the Nina Ricci perfume dynasty has been sentenced to three years in prison, two of them suspended, after being convicted on Monday of hiding money from the French taxman with the help of HSBC.
A Paris court also fined Arlette Ricci â¬1m (£722,000) after declaring she had shown a âparticularly determined willingness for more than 20 yearsâ to hide money left to her by her father in Swiss bank accounts.âThe seriousness of the facts are an exceptional threat to public order and the republican pact,â read the judgment, seen as an important precedent for as many as 50 other cases of alleged tax fraud involving HSBC in Judges also ordered the seizure of a house in Paris and a property in Corsica with a total estimated value of â¬4m, that it said had been transferred to family trusts in an alleged attempt by Ricci to âorganise her own insolvabilityâ and escape financial penalties.Ricci, 74, is the first of around 50 wealthy French nationals being pursued in the courts for allegedly placing money in During the high-profile trial, she was accused of hiding â¬18m from the French taxman. She had fiercely denied the accusations, insisting the measures taken to optimise her tax bill were legal.
The judgment comes just five days after Ricciâs tax adviser Henri-Nicolas Fleurance was given a one-year suspended prison sentence and a â¬10,000 fine for attempting to organise her insolvency, and Ricciâs daughter an eight-month suspended sentence for fiscal fraud.The heiressâs lawyers said they would consider the judgment before deciding whether to appeal.The Swiss branch of HSBC, Britainâs biggest bank, was officially put under investigation last November on allegations that it helped rich clients conceal money in offshore accounts.Ricciâs name was among around 3,000 suspected tax fraudsters holding non-declared bank accounts in Switzerland. The names featured in bank files passed to the French authorities in 2008 by HSBC employee Hervé Falciani.
Most of the cases were settled, but Ricciâs was among 50 that were handed over to the courts. She was arrested in 2011 after police turned up at her apartment on Parisâs chic Boulevard Saint-Germain in a dawn raid.Ricci was held in custody for 48 hours before being put under investigation. Her lawyers had attempted to have the case thrown out, arguing that the Falciani documents were stolen and should not be admitted as evidence.
As well as French investigations, the Swiss branch of HSBC is facing charges of fraud and money laundering in Belgium after the Brussels authorities claimed it had âknowingly eased and promoted fiscal fraud by making offshore companies available to certain privileged clientsâ.
Nina Ricci, whose real name was Maria Adélaïde Nielli, was an Italian-born clothes designer who settled in France aged 12 in 1895. She died in 1970. Her son Robert, Arlette Ricciâs father, developed the companyâs perfume sideline and raised the firmâs international profile. Arlette Ricci inherited his fortune on his death in 1988.
