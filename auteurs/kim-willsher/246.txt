French police began taking DNA samples from male pupils and staff at a secondary school in La Rochelle on Monday as part of their inquiries into the rape of a teenage girl, as investigators insisted the controversial operation was the only way to find her attacker.
Many of those tested were minors, but the public prosecutor said their parents had authorised the tests and there had not, so far, been a single refusal.
Detectives took the unusual step of carrying out mass tests on males who were identified as having been present at the private lycée Fénelon-Notre Dame de La Rochelle in the coastal town in the west of The lights were turned out and the 16-year-old victim was unable to give police any clues to the identity of her attacker. However, traces of the rapist's DNA was found on her clothing.
The attack was hushed up by the school authorities until last Friday when it was announced a judge had approved the mass testing of 475 pupils, 31 teaching staff and 21 others who were in the lycée at the time.
It is the first time such an operation has been carried out in a school.
"The DNA tests took place without difficulties within a calm and serene atmosphere," prosecutor Isabelle Pagenelle said on Monday. "All of those who were under age were in possession of their parents' authorisation â¦ nobody refused."
The pupils and staff were called in alphabetical order and the operation to take DNA samples will continue until Wednesday. By the end of the school day on Monday 251 had been tested.
School officials and investigators said there had been little opposition to the testing.
"We were told that our DNA would not be kept, that it was still something that belonged to us," student Clément Bonnau, 20, studying environmental energy, told Sud-Ouest newspaper.
Another pupil said he and his friends were willingly taking part in the testing because "we all support the young girl who was raped and we want the person responsible to be found".
"We believe there is a very great probability that the person is either part of (the school) or knows the place and because I am running this inquiry I do not see why we should close it without using all possible means to solve it," Paganelle said at a press conference.
"I am acting on behalf of the victim, to put a name to the perpetrator and above all to avoid the person reoffending."
Some parents of pupils at the school, which has 1,300 students, complained of not being informed of the rape earlier.
"What shocks me, apart from the fact that a young girl has suffered such a horrible attack, is the fact that the parents weren't told earlier," one parent wrote on the Sud-Ouest website.
"This morning, I had the feeling that my daughter was going somewhere she was at risk. Now we know about it, she won't use the toilets on her own and will stay within a group in the corridors or classes, but I'd like to have been warned before."
Jean-François Fountaine, the mayor of La Rochelle, who was present when the tests began, told BFMTV: "I was also there when the police explained to the youngsters why they were taking the samples. I sensed the pupils were mostly relaxed and I didn't sense any particular stress. Nor did I see any pupil refuse."
He added: "Looked at in a positive way, there are hundreds of people who will be declared totally innocent."
However, investigators warned that those who refused to take the test could be designated as "suspects" and face a search of their homes in order to obtain a DNA sample.
Pagenelle defended the delay in carrying out the testing, saying detectives had to make sure the DNA found on the victim's clothes did not come from a relative or from someone already on the national genetic database. She said police had not entirely excluded the possibility that the attacker came from outside the school, entered unauthorised and escaped undetected, but said investigators believed the attacker was probably someone within the establishment.
The samples will be sent to two laboratories, one in Lyon and the other in Nantes, to be compared with the DNA sample from the unknown attacker.
Chantal Devaux, headteacherat the school, told BFMTV: "We didn't have a choice, it was felt to be the only way to find the guilty person and we have to find the guilty person. If the results are all negative, it's for the police to find another line of inquiry.
"This decision was taken because it was the only way to move the inquiry forward," Devaux said.
