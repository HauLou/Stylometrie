The controversial French comedian Dieudonné M'bala M'bala has been banned from entering Britain after several of his shows were cancelled in Dieudonné had said he would travel to the UK to support his friend, footballer Nicolas Anelka, who is facing a disciplinary hearing after performing a "quenelle" â an allegedly antisemitic gesture â during a Premier League match.
The Home Office has declared the performer persona non grata and warned he will not be allowed into the country. It has alerted airlines, other transport companies and border officials that the performer, whose stage name is Dieudonné, is an "excluded" individual. A spokesperson said: "We can confirm that Mr Dieudonné is subject to an exclusion order.

Anelka, a striker with West Bromwich Albion, has been charged by the Football Association after performing a quenelle when he scored a goal against West Ham on 28 December.

He said: "We cannot tolerate antisemitism, historical revisionism and racism, and the highest jurisdiction in our country has agreed."
Dieudonné was questioned by police two weeks ago after a bailiff who arrived at the comedian's home to serve a writ claimed he was attacked. The comedian is at the centre of several official and police inquiries after allegations of unpaid fines, the "fraudulent organisation of bankruptcy", and a claim that he incited racial hatred after making antisemitic remarks about radio presenter Patrick Cohen.
During one of his shows Dieudonné told the audience: "When I hear Patrick Cohen speak, I tell myself, you know, the gas chambers â¦ a pity."
