âSomething must have happened,â I say, and for one fleeting moment Hidalgo looks truly stricken.
Something has happened. I translate one of my messages: a crazed attacker has decapitated a French businessman, placed his head on the railings of a gas depot and is, as far as any of us know, trying to blow the place sky-high at that very moment.
âMon dieu, mon dieu, where?â says Hidalgo.
âNot in Paris,â says the mayorâs press officer quickly. âOr weâd have been called.â
Heâs right, but Hidalgo, who might be forgiven a silent sigh of relief, is pained. Throughout the whole scene, there is a horrible sense of deja vu.
On the morning of 7 January this year, Hidalgo was presenting the traditional mayoral New Year wishes to Paris councillors and the public at City Hall, when a few kilometres across town, two men marched into the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and gunned down half the staff at an editorial conference.
âI was coming to the end of my talk and my office director came and whispered something about a shooting at Within half an hour, Hidalgo was at the scene of the bloodbath along with the French president, François Hollande, and the interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve.

âPeople were talking about the number of dead and there were emergency workers, police and the public prosecutor. It was then I realised the seriousness of what had happened.â
Hidalgo, who knew Charlie Hebdo editor Stéphane âCharbâ Charbonnier, says the full extent of the tragedy only hit her when she saw Patrick Pelloux, a casualty doctor and Charlie contributor, come out of the building, where he had been trying to save his dying friends. Pelloux, alerted by one of the survivors immediately after the massacre, which left 12 dead, was one of the first to arrive after the killers left. Hidalgoâs expression turns grim and her hands, once described as looking as if they are making pottery in the air while she speaks, drop into her lap.
âI saw the state Patrick Pelloux was in ... such a state. I was comforting him and he told me Charb was dead. I was absolutely knocked over. Then we heard about the others ... it was utterly unreal, truly, truly terrible.
âEven today when I talk about that day, I feel the tears come.â Her eyes, which have indeed welled up, keep contact with mine, and again she looks stricken.
âIt seemed so, so unfair â they were pacifists, they were the journalists and cartoonists we grew up with as children. They were like the big adolescents of your family â provocative, but in the French spirit, in the Parisian spirit of debates and confrontation through ideas. Suddenly it was like part of our heritage, our values, our light had been directly attacked.â
Later that evening, Hidalgo joined a spontaneous gathering of tens of thousands of people in the symbolic Place de la République, where candles were lit in honour of the dead.
It was, she tells me, âa very long and heavy dayâ, but Parisâs ordeal was far from over.
The following day, a policewoman was gunned down by another self-declared jihadist who went on to murder four more people in a Jewish supermarket, Hyper Cacher, 24 hours later, before being killed in a police shootout.
âI went to Hyper Cacher, too; it was like a scene from a war. Again, it was terrible. Just terrible ...â the sentence trails off as she shakes her head.
Hidalgo had been running Paris for just nine months, and nothing â not even 13 years as deputy mayor â could have prepared her for such a tragedy. As with Ken Livingstone after the 7/7 attacks in London and Rudy Giuliani after 9/11, Hidalgo found herself stepping up as a figurehead for the bruised city.
Echoing the sentiment of the shocked but defiant crowd in Place de la République, she rallied Parisians: âWe are standing, the republic is standing and we will not give up ... those who were killed were magnificent people who used one weapon, a pencil. We will not abandon the liberty and force they gave us,â she told them.
Six months later, sitting in her light and airy office overlooking the Seine (at 155 sq m itâs the biggest public office in That those three days were seismic quickly became obvious. Suddenly, everyone was Charlie, or Ahmed (a Muslim police officer who was shot in the head by one of the gunmen as he lay injured on the ground outside the magazineâs office). âJe suis Charlieâ became the slogan for the suffering city. World leaders, with the conspicuous exception of Barack Obama, converged on Paris to show their support for freedom and liberty of the press.
âThe collective spirit this city that I adore showed after the attacks took my breath away. It said: Paris is conscious of that threat, but its people insist on being able to live together and promote our community model,â Hidalgo says.
Hidalgoâs own life story may be at the root of that conviction. The Spanish-born eldest daughter of an immigrant factory worker and a seamstress, she spent her childhood on a run-down housing estate on the outskirts of Lyon. Her parents arrived from Cádiz in southern Spain when she was two, and lived with Anà â as she was then â and her sister Maria in a high-rise block with no bathrooms or lifts. At 14, she took French nationality and changed her name. School was her escape, and Paris her dream. âI wanted to go to Paris to meet Sartre,â she told Libération.
Shortly after becoming Parisâs first female mayor 14 months ago, she told me it was her âdream jobâ â even if her family (she has two grownup children from a first marriage and a teenage son with her second husband, the French politician Jean-Marc Germain) have had to learn not to expect her home for dinner. If her idealism remains, it is now qualified: her âsocial democratâ worldview â old Labour, in British terms â is tempered by realism about the need to woo business leaders. Her staff seem happy, too, describing her as charming on a personal level and choosing consultation and consensus over conflict in her politics.
A year ago, the most damning criticism was that she lacked the charisma of her much-loved predecessor, Bertrand Delanoë. A year on, even those who wrote her off as Delanoëâs dauphine admit a grudging respect.
Hidalgo looks genuinely pleased when I tell her the City Hall underlings I have canvassed seem to adore her. The feeling is mutual; her office is huge, but Hidalgoâs ego does not match it. She is warm, first with the âShe insists on feminising her title to In a previous interview she admitted being a âFrench feministâ who believed in justice and equality âbased on performanceâ, as opposed to what she controversially labelled an âAnglo-Saxon idea that women should have power because they are better than menâ. Today her response is gentler but more confident.
She recounts how she recently opened a new kindergarten, and was delighted to discover one of the children thought she was the If this sounds all too twee, critics and opponents quickly learn not to underestimate her. An âiron fist in a velvet glove ... she likes to get her way,â is how one colleague described her.
Her stance on reducing pollution by introducing alternate bans on half the cityâs vehicles saw her and the ecology minister, Ségolène Royal, squaring up. Motorists are furious, but most Parisians love her idea of turning the traffic-choked banks of the Seine into a pedestrian zone and reclaiming emblematic squares such as Place de la Bastille and Place de la Nation from vehicles.âWe have to do this quickly and with giant steps,â she says firmly. âI know the people of Paris feel the same way.â
Hidalgoâs call for Paris to have a sort of drop-in âwelcome centreâ for migrants, just days after the interior minister dispatched riot police to dismantle an illegal camp in the north of the city, has also veered from the government line. As a migrant herself, Hidalgo says she understands their plight. And she declares herself determined to try to redress some of the more blatant inequalities of east-west, north-south Paris, and believes creating affordable housing is the key.
âI push the message that itâs important we share Paris,â she says. âParis is a collection of different areas â wealthy and working-class â and each is important. If you take just one of those areas away, you take away part of the strength of the city.â
After Jacques Chirac made the job a springboard to the Elysée Palace in 1995, some have suggested Hidalgo might have her sights set on the top job, something she has always strenuously denied. When the photographer jokingly requests she tries a pose that is âa little less presidentialâ, she laughs. âNon, non, non, please donât say that!â
That city mayors might have presidential or prime-ministerial ambitions is a forgivable assumption, as a glance across the Channel shows. Then again, Boris Johnson and Anne Hidalgo could hardly be more different, as their meeting earlier this year demonstrated. The press conference that followed was excruciatingly tense, as Hidalgo remained cool and Boris behaved ... like Boris: ruffling his hair, making jokes, playing the buffoon. After the unlikely Could this possibly be true?
âOui, oui, we really did get on well and I do like him. He is, what is the word, exuberant and, dare I say it, our idea of the archetypal Englishman: original, brilliant, funny,â says Hidalgo. âOur relationship is confident, direct and joyful. He likes a joke and I can give as good as I get.â
So will she be going to London any time soon? A visit earlier this year was postponed and no new date has been given.
âBoris invited me to come to London to ride a tandem, so I shall be coming. The only question is who will be in front. I think we will have to draw straws on that.â
Hidalgo likes to say that âseen from Shanghaiâ, London and Paris are twin dots, but she is keenly aware of the fierce competition between the two cities, never more evident than when London won a surprise victory over Paris in the battle to host the 2012 Olympics. In London, a day of jubilation was immediately followed by the horror of the 7/7 attacks. So it is perhaps fitting that just as the Olympics became a symbol of hope and revival for London, Hidalgo has rethought her previous opposition to Paris trying again, and approved a bid for 2024.
Itâs a brave move when her predecessorâs failure to secure the 2012 Games was such a devastating blow to him and the city, but it is a logical extension of Hidalgoâs optimism and determination that Paris not be cowed.
âParis dreams of something else, and that is fraternity, which is what the march expressed,â she says. âAfterwards I felt the need of those young people involved to be carried along by a project, like the Olympics, in which they had their part to play. So I thought, letâs give it a go.â
âCharlie Hebdo changed Paris,â she goes on. âIt made people aware of the strength of that collective state of mind. Everyone went on with their lives saying: âYou will not kill our spirit. You will not silence us.â We Parisians, we French, marched supported by the whole world.â
