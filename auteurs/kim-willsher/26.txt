Two of the bibles of the French language, the Petit Larousse encyclopaedic dictionary and Le Petit Robert, have developed a few new culinary and artistic tastes.
On Monday, the editors announced the latest editions would contain 300 new words and expressions including âfocacciaâ, âbiryaniâ, âgojiâ and âveganâ.
Showing it is moving with the times, and in defiance of the Académie Françaiseâs diktatâs on anglicisms, the 2016 Larousse will include what Libération described as the âunbearableâ word âselfieâ â plus its Québécois equivalent âégoportraitâ â as well as âbig dataâ and âopen dataâ, âcommunity managerâ and âbitcoinâ. It will also include the term âcaptchaâ for those annoying series of numbers and letters websites demand to prove the user is human.
Notable cultural additions will be the celebrated veteran French philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy, actor Michael Caine, the British street artist Banksy as well as the Rosetta space probe and Pixar studios. 
Stéphane Charbonnier, known as Charb, the editor-in-chief of Charlie Hebdo, and his cartoonist colleague Jean Cabut, aka Cabu â both killed by Islamic fundamentalists in January â have also been included in Le Petit Robert, as has the Nobel peace prize-winning Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai in the new Larousse.
While Libération says the inclusion and definition of âbolosâ â with one âsâ and described as âa naive person, someone with little courage, completely ridiculous, even stupidâ â will cause controversy and is possibly plain wrong, some of the new terms need little translation: âélectrosensibilitéâ, âghettoïserâ, ârecyclerieâ and âclimatosceptiqueâ among them.
And if you do not know what they mean, Larousse has a word for you too: âla loserâ.
