"This film is such a wonderful, marvellous, extraordinary gift. I cannot tell you how happy I am. Completely happy," Riva says. "The whole thing is like a fairytale. Everybody knows there are very few roles for older actresses. Almost none, in fact. And that is what makes all this so exceptional."
Riva will not be at the Bafta awards ceremony at the Royal Opera House in London on Sunday, where she is nominated for a best actress award. She is saving herself for the Gallic equivalent, the Césars, in a fortnight. Then the Oscars â on the day of her 86th birthday â beckon.
The acclaim for Riva and What? A star who cannot wait for her 15 minutes in the spotlight to be over? Riva is not being curmudgeonly (well, not much), but it is easy to forget that she is not playing at being an octogenarian. Besides, she enjoyed global recognition more than half a century ago in the cult 1959 film In that film, in which 30-year-old Riva plays an unnamed French woman talking to her young Japanese lover about the bombing of Hiroshima, it is her voice, poetically repeating the same lines, that is etched on the memory long after the black-and-white credits rolled. Speaking from her Paris flat, 54 years on, Riva's voice is still as mellifluous and as gently mesmerising.
In The critics have raved about Riva says she knew she wanted the role as soon as she read the script. "I knew intimately that I could do it, that I had arrived at a point in my life to do it. It seemed like a miracle. Haneke had seen "He had already chosen Trintignant to play the husband. When I knew it was Trintignant I thought we would work well together on the film. And we did. Nobody who has seen the film can doubt that this is a couple who love each other, a couple everyone can believe in."
She adds: "I would have been very unhappy if he [Haneke] had chosen someone else for the role. As it was I was very happy. Totally happy throughout the whole two months of shooting."
Riva, the only daughter of an Italian signwriter and his wife, was born in eastern France. She decided as a child she wanted to be an actress, but for a girl living in a provincial village, from a modest family with no connection to the world of theatre or cinema, it seemed an impossible ambition.
"My father wanted me to continue my studies. To do what â¦ who knows? I knew my passion was acting. But in the meantime I had to do something so I learned to sew. My parents certainly didn't decide my destiny was as a seamstress, as some have written."
Legend has it that Riva's father was painting a shop sign when the owner, who also ran the local amateur dramatics group, asked if he knew of a young girl interested in taking a role in the next play. Afterwards, Riva, then in her early 20s, left for Paris where she enrolled in acting school.
"I would have liked to have started acting at 17 years old, but it was a miracle in itself that I even got started at all."
After Haneke told the In the past half century, Riva did not completely disappear. She worked on the stage until 2001 and had roles in "Of course I am totally in this role. I don't have any regrets because I couldn't have done a role like this at 40 years of age. This film arrived at the exact age of my life. What regrets could I possibly have?" she says.
Riva is weary of journalists' questions. I ask if she prefers to be called Madame or Mademoiselle; the French divas Catherine Deneuve and Jeanne Moreau are said to prefer Mademoiselle.
"What do you mean do I prefer being called Madame or Mademoiselle? Are you trying to find out if I am married? If so I can tell you that I have never wanted to be married and you can call me Mademoiselle or Madame as you wish. Perhaps at my age Madame has more charm, it's more dignified. But I could call myself Mademoiselle."
She insists she had no idea "How could I say no to this film? A project so marvellous, of such quality with such a director. I didn't ask questions, I just said yes," she says. "They said the film's story would make people afraid, would put them off. It hasn't. The truth is this story could happen to anyone. It could happen to me, it could happen to you; it's about the very important subjects: life, love death."
