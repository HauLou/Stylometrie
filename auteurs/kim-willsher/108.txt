Marion Maréchal-Le Pen, the granddaughter of the founder of Franceâs far-right Front National (FN), has seen off heavyweight rivals to win a top seat on the partyâs central committee.
The 24-year-old won a landslide 80% of party membersâ votes at an FN congress on Saturday.
The victory is another step in the seemingly unstoppable rise of Maréchal-Le Pen, who was hailed as the republicâs youngest ever member of parliament after she was elected to the Assemblée Nationale in 2012.
Along with her grandfather Maréchal-Le Pen, whose mother is Yann Le Pen, the second of Le Pen seniorâs three daughters, joined the FN in 2008 and stood for her first municipal election the same year, abandoning her studies in 2012 to devote herself to politics.
The FNâs 83,000 members who took part in the postal election gave Maréchal-Le Pen more votes than the partyâs number two Florian Philippot and Louis Aliot, Marine Le Penâs partner. There were a total of 400 candidates for places on the partyâs central committee.

âI am delighted and honoured. This allows me to have a legitimacy above and beyond my name. I thank the voters and hope to be worthy of this confidence,â she told journalists after learning of her unexpected victory.

Given a standing ovation, Le Pen senior launched into a 15-minute address on his favourite theme of immigration.
He spoke of the âIslamist tsunamiâ threatening âMassive immigration is not the only cause of Franceâs decline, but itâs the biggest and most important,â he said.
He called on the French to make his daughter president âthe sooner the better because Franceâs situation is getting worse by the dayâ.
