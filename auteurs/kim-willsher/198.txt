The French port of Saint-Nazaire woke to find the Russian naval ensign â a blue cross â flying offshore on Monday and a new row over France's sale of state-of-the-art warships to Moscow.
While the president, François Hollande, was playing the peacemaker by trying to negotiate a ceasefire between the Russians and Ukrainians on Monday, 400 Russian sailors arrived to be trained in using the high-tech Mistral-class ship, the Vladivostok.
Earlier, pro-Ukrainian demonstrators called on France to cancel the â¬1.2bn (£960m) deal to deliver two of the warships with amphibious assault capabilities to 
The US and neighbouring states in eastern Europe, including However, Moscow has threatened to hit There are also concerns in Saint-Nazaire that any decision to cancel the sale would lead to the loss of between 600 and 1,000 shipbuilding jobs and thousands more among subcontractors in a region where unemployment already tops 14%.
A member of the CGT union at the naval construction company STX said locals were between a rock and a hard place.
"What we need are orders for civil boats not military ones but this is a political decision. We get sent the contracts and we carry them out," he told the Guardian.
"We're a bit stuck now. It's not for us to decide if these ships are delivered to the Russians. I don't know if people are pro-Ukrainian or not locally, what I know is threat there is massive unemployment and a lot of foreigners being employed as cheap labour. Like everyone else we need jobs and food."
The 400 Russian sailors arrived in the port on Monday hours before the Russian president, In a four-way conference call with Hollande and the German chancellor Angela Merkel, Russia and The Russian sailors will be trained by staff of the French company Defense Conseil International, and taken on sea trials to learn how to manoeuvre the ships. Around 40 of their officers have been in Saint-Nazaire for several weeks.
Nathalie Pasternak, president of the Ukrainian community in France committee, said the French government should not hand over the ships but "find other buyers".
She said France should do "anything except hand over a war weapon that will be used by the Russians in Ukraine. And not only in Ukraine. The Baltic states are very worried. With a ship like this, Putin can go even quicker, nothing will stop him."
The Franco-Russian deal was struck in 2011 under centre-right former president Nicolas Sarkozy. Hollande has defended the decision to deliver the ships saying: "a deal is a deal".
The Vladivostok, whose helm was built in Russia and transported 3,000km by sea to the French port, is due to be handed over to the Russians in October. A second Mistral warship, named the Sévastopol after the heavily disputed Black Sea port in the Crimea, is set to be delivered in October 2015.
The Mistral, the biggest French-built ships after the aircraft carrier the Charles de Gaul, is 199m long, weighs 22,000 tonnes, and can carry 177 crew, 16 heavy helicopters or 30 light, 70 armoured vehicles such as tanks, 450 troops and four landing craft. It can act as a command and control centre and has a fully equipped field hospital.
Last month, Dr Robbin Laird of the Washington-based consultancy told Defense News that Paris was "trapped" on the Vladivostok, but was "clearly looking for an alternative" on the Sevastopol.
"The situation is not easy, but France can show leadership," Laird said. "It's about influence. This is an ideal ship for the 21st century."
Officials at France's far-right Front National in the Loire-Atlantique region, welcomed the arrival of the Russian sailors, saying: "The successful conclusion of this contract, despite pressure from abroad, is something extremely positive for not only the STX shipyard, but for the whole town of Saint-Nazaire and for French foreign policy."
The FN has remained staunchly pro-Russian throughout the Ukraine crisis.
In May, a group of American congressmen called on France to cancel the contract, and sell the ships or rent them to The Baltic states have expressed concern over the ships being in the hands of Vladimir Putin, who has said publicly he will "do whatever he wants" with them.
Polish foreign affairs minister Radoslaw Sikorski has opposed the ships being handed over. "We have named Russia as the aggressor in the Crimea and I don't think France wants to be in the position of furnishing efficient weapons to an aggressor," Sikorski said.
He told Le Monde earlier this month: "When a country seizes by force part of its neighbour's territory it's not the best time to be supplying them with sophisticated armaments."
France has suggested it might be inclined to freeze the contracts if there was a Europe-wide package of sanctions against Russia including Britain agreeing to freeze the assets of Russian oligarchs in London.
