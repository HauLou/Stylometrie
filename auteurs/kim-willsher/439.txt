The French press called it Monday was deadline day for French MPs to reveal their wealth and assets in an historic exercise after the shaming of a former minister who lied about having money in a secret Swiss bank account.
The result was embarrassment for a variety of reasons. Michèle Delaunay, the minister for the elderly, was concerned that "ordinary French people" might find her wealth, estimated at â¬5.4m (£4.6m) â including â¬3m in property, a â¬200,000 art collection and â¬15,000 in jewels plus â¬10,000 of watches â "difficult to understand".
The foreign affairs minister, Laurent Fabius, declared a net worth of â¬6.07m, made up mostly of a â¬2.7m apartment in Paris and two country homes, while the prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, declared he was worth â¬1.55m. Just under half of this was his â¬650,000 home in Nantes and a second home in Britanny.
On a different scale, the housing minister, Cécile Duflot, of the Green party, had already become the subject of internet derision after admitting she owns a 1999 Renault Twingo worth â¬1,500. Her party colleague, the former presidential candidate Eva Joly, went even better, disclosing that she owns two kayaks that are "expensive because they're made of carbon".
Arnaud Montebourg, the minister for industrial renewal and pinup boy for the Made in Having no ministerial post, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, head of the Parti de Gauche, who had opposed the great confession, had no need to declare anything. However, he could not resist making an unofficial declaration of assets on his blog as the first of the ministers' declarations became known last week: "I'm 1.74 metres tall. I weight 79kg. My shirt size is 41/42. My trouser size is 42, and I take a size 42 shoe. All my hair is my own and is not dyed," he wrote. He also admitted owning an apartment, a house, some savings and 12,000 books. But he added he had "no horses".
Some of those wandering the Gallic corridors of power, however, were saying nothing. Claude Bartolone, the Socialist president of the Assemblée Nationale, is not obliged to reveal his wealth, and has said he will not do so.
"I have serious concerns about the respect of privacy," Bartolone said. "I'm concerned about any initiative that could feed populism. To declare, check and punish, that's transparency; to make it public, that's voyeurism," he told Le Figaro.
The Socialist president, François Hollande, gave all 38 ministers until 5pm French time on Monday to declare their assets on the government's website in a push to "clean up" French politics. But the list was delayed for two hours to enable the prime minister's office to "secure the site" and deal with the expected influx of visitors.
It is the first time such an operation has been attempted.
Hollande said he would not be publishing a list of his material assets as they "had not changed in the last year".
As is customary for French presidents, Hollande published his declaration, showing he was worth around â¬1.17m when he entered the Elysée, in May 2012.
This included a house at Mougins, in the Alpes Maritimes, worth â¬800,000 and two apartments in Cannes worth â¬370,000 together.
The "moralisation" move follows the resignation of the budget minister, Jérôme Cahuzac, the man in charge of rooting out tax evasion, who was found to have money hidden in a Swiss bank account.
Cahuzac had denied the accusations "eye to eye" with Hollande and in front of the Assemblée Nationale, but eventually confessed to having the account. He is now under formal investigation for "laundering the proceeds of tax evasion".
Opposition MPs from the centre-right UMP have condemned the push for transparency.
For the UMP president, Jean-François Copé, The political analyst Luc Rouban told BFMTV: "In general, it's not good to have significant wealth when one is of the left. In a period of crisis, it creates a backlash."
The sociologist Janine Mossuz-Lavau said the French people found it "much more difficult to talk about money than about sex".
Several ministers pointed out that since households and not individuals are taxed in France, they were declaring their family worth and not their individual wealth.
