The homeless, unemployed guys kicking their heels around the exit of the former Saint Martin metro near Paris's symbolic Place de la République, do not need a swimming pool, a nightclub or a restaurant.
The men, of various origins and uncertain ages, their faces and gaits ravaged from life on the street, need what the phantom station gives them: coffee, breakfast, a shower, advice, even books to borrow. Attempting to explain plans to transform this, a Salvation Army "day centre", into something considerably more glossy, attractive and what the French would call "idea proposed by centre-right mayoral candidate Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet seems utterly foreign and, frankly, fantastical.
Don't worry," says a passer-by overhearing the conversation. "It'll never happen."
Some weeks previously, across Paris in the city's billionaires' row, clusters of news reporters and nimbys had waited in the cold and rain for the election frontrunner and Kosciusko-Morizet's rival, Socialist Anne Hidalgo. In the shadow of magnificent shuttered properties, many owned by foreign oligarchs, dictators, kleptocrats and royals, the protesters waved hastily made banners opposing Hidalgo's plan to transform Baron Haussmann's grand Avenue Foch, a one-time walkway for the wealthy, into a "green corridor" for the masses. "Non to Mme Hidalgo's Luna Park", they read. Hidalgo declared the plans for a park, pedestrian area and playground ""We're already building social housing," lamented one protester in the arrondissement that has only 2.5% of council houses, far short of the 20% required by law. "Fifteen or so flats, over there," he waved his hands in a vague direction. "It's crazy, it'll never happen," said his neighbour. It was not clear to which construction project he was referring.
As France's two-round municipal elections approach (23 and 30 March), the two women in a duel to become the capital's first Madame le Maire are digging deeper into the box marked "grandstanding ideas unlikely to see the light of day" (not least because both have promised not to raise city taxes).
On the left is the favourite, Spanish-born Hidalgo, 54, protégée of current mayor Bertrand Delanoë and disparagingly referred to as Madani Cheurfa, a political analyst at Cevipof, the study centre on French political life, believes the Paris municipal elections, as elsewhere in France, have been infected by the general cloud of gloom that has descended on the whole republic. He said Paris's educated population (41.7% of adults with higher education, compared with a national average of 12%), many of whom live alone (51.3% compared with 33% across the country), was more politically conscious and motivated than elsewhere, but blamed a lack of clear water between the two candidates for muddying the election.
"The principal game being played by the candidates is one of consensus. Everyone is agreed that it's important to fight unemployment, to fight homelessness, to fight cancer. It's like saying 'war is bad'; everyone agrees," Cheurfa said. "Everyone agrees that the priority is housing, because that's what the opinion polls say Parisians are most concerned about, then transport because this is an everyday concern for those in the city, and crime. The problem is there just isn't much between them. They both agree on the subjects and it just comes down to details and figures; how many new homes, how many creches."
"The consequence of this is that we have seen the campaign become super-personalised and simplified in the media and social networks. The fact that there are two women candidates, which is original, has magnified this."
Unfortunately, the candidates have done little to dispel the nagging feeling that this campaign is about image over ideas or ideals. Hidalgo arrived for her Avenue Foche walkabout in a stubby black Smart car, a gesture that smacked, like Boris Johnson being photographed taking a bus, of a politician trying too hard. Even more breathtaking was Hidalgo's official campaign poster released last week, showing a heavily retouched (Hidalgo's team denied this) portrait described by French PR veteran Jacques Séguéla as like "a L'Oréal advert for anti-wrinkle cream". "It's not natural at all," Séguéla told NKM's communications team has been tripped up by a series of damaging faux-pas, and too obvious attempts by Kosciusko-Morizet to appear just another woman on the Paris omnibus have backfired spectacularly. She was photographed using a free Vélib' bicycle â all very ordinary â but someone pointed out the â¬2,000 designer handbag in the front basket, while the inappropriate stiletto heels she sported while on the back of a scooter for another publicity shot could not go unnoticed.
Ridicule abounded on social networks after NKM, pictured looking wistfully out of a metro train window, described the city's underground network as a "place of charm", particularly line 13, one of the most crowded and moaned about. Not knowing, when asked, the cost of a metro ticket did not do anything to promote her woman-of-the-people image.
The laughs, however, turned to boos when she was photographed, in a leather jacket and jeans, smoking what looked like a rollup with a group of homeless men. It brought a lambasting in the columns of the Huffington Post from the current minister for social exclusion, Marie-Arlette Carlotti, who wrote a column entitled "Madame Kosciusko-Morizet, a bit of decency!". In it, she wrote: "You were minister and spokesperson for Nicolas Sarkozy who promised in 2006 there would be no more homeless. You have recently called for the return to anti-begging laws in Paris. Today you're posing like a model in company with people on the streets, pretending to be hanging out and sympathetic â¦ your ambition doesn't allow you to use impoverished people." The former budget minister, Alain Lambert, said the photo was an "example of disastrous political communication".
Since NKM published her plans for Paris's ghost metro stations, including turning one into a swimming pool, Hidalgo has clearly decided that water is the new solid political ground, promising renovations to existing pools and new ones, including floating pools on the Seine. It would be nice to think it might happen.
For the Salvation Army and the careworn guys outside the unused Saint Martin station, however, there are much more important priorities. "Food, equality for children, homes, proper facilities for foreign immigrants, that sort of thing," said a spokesperson for the organisation. "Just basic services."
