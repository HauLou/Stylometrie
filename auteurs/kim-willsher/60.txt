Franceâs mainstream parties gave a collective â if qualified â sigh of relief on Sunday after they appeared to have seen off a threat from the far-right Front National.
Opinion surveys in the run up to Sundayâs vote had suggested the FN, led by Instead, early estimates released as the last of the polling stations closed on Sunday evening suggested the UMP had won a convincing lead and the PS had narrowly avoided total humiliation.
Provisional figures gave the opposition centre right UMP party around 37%, president François Hollandeâs PS 27% and the FN between 23 and 26%. The results will not be confirmed until later Sunday night or Monday morning, but several independent opinion polls confirmed the PS had narrowly defeated the FN.

While Sundayâs result will be a blow for the FN and its anti-immigrant, anti-euro and anti-European Union stance, it firmly establishes the party as the third key player on the French political landscape and will encourage Le Pen for the 2017 presidential elections.Afterwards, prime minister Manuel Valls said it was an âhonourable scoreâ for the Socialist government and said it proved the âextreme right is not the first political force in Franceâ. However, he was forced to admit that support for the FN was still âtoo strongâ and abstention still too high.âThe total of votes for the left is the same as those for the right. This means nothing has been decided during this first round vote, and the left must unify,â Valls said.He appealed for voters to turn out in strength for the second round vote next Sunday.Sarkozy ruled out any agreement âeither at national or local levelâ with the FN in areas where the UMP was in a runoff with the PS for the second vote.However, in what is seen as a âneither-norâ stance, he said his party would not call for supporters to vote for the PS or other left-wing parties in areas where this would defeat the FN.Marine Le Pen hid her disappointment, telling supporters at the party headquarters at Nanterre just outside Paris: âFor those who want to get rid of the PS, the FN is key.âFranceâs departmental elections, characterised by high abstention, have rarely provoked such excitement and suspense.
It was feared that Hollande and the PS, as well as other leftwing parties, had completely alienated core and key voters from Franceâs blue-collar working classes.
Various analysts have tried to explain the growing popularity of the FN in Political science professor Laurent Bouvet, of the thinktank the Jean-Jaurès Foundation, which advises the PS and aims to âpromote the study of workersâ movements and international socialism and promote democratic and humanist ideasâ, told The Observer the French left was suffering after abandoning blue-collar workers.

He blamed the rise in support for the FN on an identity crisis among the countryâs working classes.Christophe Guilluy, a geographer and one of Hollandeâs advisors, views the phenomenon as geographic.In his books Guilluy argues the country divides into âLa France metropolitaineâ, made up of the 25 biggest towns/cities and their banlieues (suburbs), representing 10% of communes, 40% of the population and two thirds of Franceâs gross domestic product, and âLa France périphériqueâ, made up of the rest of the country including rural villages, peri-urban areas and middle-size towns.While those in the former, including the outer city banlieues, have flourished under globalisation, those ânew working classes in la France périphériqueâ including ânative French...and those from old immigration wavesâ are pushed out and âforgottenâ, he argues.Bouvet, whose book lâInsécurité Culturelle has caused a storm in France, described the FN as a âdanger for the Republicâ.
