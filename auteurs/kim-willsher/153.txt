She portrayed him as a cold, cruel and calculating man whose cheating drove her to swallow a large dose of sleeping tablets.
However, the accusation that hurt the French president, François Hollande, the most in a kiss-and-tell book by his former partner Valerie Trierweiler is her claim that he despises the poor and calls them the "In an exclusive interview with Le Nouvel Observateur to be published on Thursday, Hollande addresses the term, already set to become a leitmotif of his beleaguered administration.
"I felt this attack on the poor, the dispossessed, as if it were a blow to my whole life," Hollande says. "In all the posts I have held, I have only thought of helping, representing those who suffer. I have never been on the side of the powerful, even if I'm not their enemy, but I know where I come from."
He adds: "You think I have forgotten from where I come? My maternal grandfather, a Savoyard tailor, lived with his family in a simple two-room flat in Paris. My paternal grandfather, a teacher, came from a poor rural family from northern "Yes, I have met people in difficult circumstances, ground down by life. They cannot afford to look after their teeth. It's a sign of the worst misery. These people I have been among, I have helped them and supported them."
Le Nouvel Observateur describes Hollande, known for his witty asides and jokes, as looking "serious" and "sober-faced" during the interview at the Elysée Palace.
The magazine says Trierweiler's book â Merci pour ce moment (Thanks for the Moment) published last week â is a "300-page crime of passion". All 200,000 copies of the first print run sold out within days and more are being produced.
The book, described as a memoir, details 49-year-old Trierweiler's nine-year relationship with Hollande, 60, and their acrimonious split in January this year after he had an affair with the actor Julie Gayet, 42. In it she says he mocked her family's modest background and referred with disdain to the poor as "Hollande, whose popularity was rock bottom even before the book came out and whose Socialist government is facing a vote of confidence next week, said the damaging accusation was a lie.
"What I'm going through at the moment is not pleasant, but what do you want me to do â¦ go crying about my problems in front of the French, start whingeing? I'm not a demagogue or an actor; the French expect something else from me, they want results," he said.
"My state of mind doesn't interest them and they are right. I want to remain true to myself. I have never cheated, never sought to make people believe that I am anything other than I am. But I don't want people to say or write that I make fun of people's suffering because that's a lie that hurts me."
