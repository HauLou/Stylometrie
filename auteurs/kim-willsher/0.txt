Champagne corks popped in The United Nations cultural body decided that the âhillsides, houses and cellarsâ producing and selling champagne were significant enough to merit the award.
The decision, which followed intense lobbying by France, means the production area will receive special protection.
France had double reasons for celebration as its Burgundy vineyards were also listed as world heritage sites.It mentioned the historic vineyards of Hautvillers â where, local legend has it, the monk Dom Perignon invented the fermentation process that gives champagne its fizz â and the grand Avenue de Champagne in Épernay, the heart of the industry. In Burgundy, Unesco recognised the uniqueness of the vineyards of the Côte de Nuits and the Côte de Beaune south of the city Dijon which produce some of the finest red wines in the world made from pinot noir and chardonnay grapes.It listed the Climats, which are precisely delimited vineyard parcels âon the slopes of the Côte de Nuits and the Côte de Beauneâ south of the city of Dijon. âThey differ from one another due to specific natural conditions [geology and exposure] as well as vine types and have been shaped by human cultivation. Over time they came to be recognised by the wine they produce,â Unesco said.It concluded: âThe site is an outstanding example of grape cultivation and wine production developed since the high middle agesâ.
Frédéric Dufour, president of Maison Ruinart, the first established champagne house in the region, said on Sunday: âWe are delighted with this news. It recognises our commitment to upholding our heritage all the while encouraging us to respect it and keep it alive.âWe are very proud of this classification â¦ it is a very special distinction for all the men and women who have developed the region. The were driven by their passion, courage and the pursuit of excellence.âThe French president, François Hollande, said the awards were âa mark of international recognition of the exceptional heritage of these regions and shows the diversity and energy of these lands that are the wealth of our countryâ. Other sites given similar status at a Unesco meeting in Germany on Saturday were the Botanic Gardens in Singapore, DiyarbakÄ±r fortress in Turkey and the Raymond cave dwellings in Iran.However, some have questioned the purpose of world heritage sites after the ruins of Palmyra in Syria were taken over by Islamic State in May. The list of 1,022 Unesco world heritage sites already includes the Taj Mahal in India, the Great Wall of China, and Machu Picchu in Peru.In Britain, Westminster Palace and Abbey, Kew Gardens, and Stonehenge are among 28 listed sites.
