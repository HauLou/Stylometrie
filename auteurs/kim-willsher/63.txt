Carrie and Mr Big chose the Pont des Arts for their kiss in the final episode of However, it seems that not all kissers are equal in the land of One of the women on the receiving end of the homophobic rant, Mirjam, 35, from Amsterdam, a member of the organisation All Out, called for gay rights activists to complain to the company in a massive demonstration of solidarity.
âImagine it. You spent the weekend with your partner in Paris. You say goodbye on the train platform with a hug and a kiss. Itâll be a while until you see each other again. Then an angry train official strides over to stop you kissing â he says it âcanât be toleratedâ. Humiliating,â she wrote on the All Out site. âMy girlfriend and I canât believe that a Thalys official picked on us just because weâre not a straight couple.â
Later, she told In 2013, Thalys launched an advertising campaign showing couples, including a same-sex couple, embracing, having been reunited by Thalys trains.
âJust like us! But in reality, they didnât let me kiss my girlfriend on the platform. And theyâre staying silent after one of their staff went on an anti-gay rant,â Mirjam wrote. âThis isnât just about this one personâs anti-gay rant, itâs about pushing the company to turn their marketing messages into action and ensure they treat everyone fairly.â

Ingrid Nuelant, deputy CEO at Thalys, said staff received regular training on equality issues: âThalys has always shown open values without any ambiguity through its publicity campaigns and in its support of pride marches â¦ This incident profoundly affects us and from now will be used as a case history to make our agents more aware.â
On Saturday All Out announced that 60,000 people had signed a petition calling for Thalys to be sanctioned.
