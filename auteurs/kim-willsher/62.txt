At an election meeting just days before Franceâs regional elections, a Japanese journalist asked Polls suggest that the FN vote will reach unprecedented levels, with up to 30% of the vote, just ahead of the opposition Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party and leaving the ruling Socialist party trailing.
âThe Front National is alone against everyone. The French people have realised for some time now that the Front Nationalâs analysis is right, and the other political parties have failed,â Le Pen responded. The FN had gone from âa party of opposition â¦ to a movement of governmentâ by addressing âthe economy, immigration and Islamic fundamentalismâ, she added.
From Le Pen, a damning analysis of this type might be expected. But from a member of the leftwing commentariat? A new âstate of the nationâ tome, Bouvet accuses the left of sparking an identity crisis â âcultural insecurityâ â among its core blue-collar electorate, by almost exclusively focusing on the problems of minority groups instead of French society as a whole. This has left the workers feeling cast adrift and alienated, he says.
âThe economic crisis, unemployment, social problems, globalisation make people afraid, but if it was just about economics we would see these people voting for the radical left, which they are not,â Bouvet told the Bouvet is a political science professor and member of the leftwing thinktank the Jean Jaurès Foundation, which advises the Socialist party (PS) and aims to âpromote the study of workersâ movements and international socialism and promote democratic and humanist ideasâ. He says his latest, decidedly politically incorrect, message is one the left does not want to hear.
Bouvet says PC blinkers have prevented the Socialists from addressing working-class anxieties about immigration and the rise of Islam â even in its moderate form â in areas where the so-called âWith no political offer from the left, working-class French people feel they have been abandoned economically, socially and culturally. The FN has stepped into the breach: it says to these people: âyou are the most important and we will fight for youâ.
âThe left is trying to make up to what it calls âreal minoritiesâ who it believes are discriminated against. In doing so it has become indifferent, even scornful, of the wider French working class. They say to these native French âyou have not understood, you are racist and sexistâ, and so these people have said, so be it. They are ready to admit voting FN because the left has abandoned them and the FN is interested in them.â
Bouvet is particularly scathing of the Socialist âideas laboratoryâ Terra Nova, unveiled before Hollandeâs successful 2012 presidential election, which suggested the Socialists could win by emulating Barack Obamaâs mobilisation of the African, Latino and female vote, and by abandoning its traditional alliance with the middle and working classes.
In a document entitled François de Closets, 81, a former AFP journalist and essayist on French society, agrees with Bouvetâs analysis that the French âpolitical eliteâ has ignored and, worse, scorned the working classes.
âFor the left, for the bobos (bourgeois bohemians), only the gay or ethnic minorities were interesting. It is fascinating to think that a whole generation of researchers whose job it is to observe French society has through ideological blindness not seen this section of France in danger of being attracted to Le Pen,â de Closets said in a recent interview.
âSince the 1990s weâve seen the workers vote for the FN,â he added. âThe party is a chameleon that feeds on anger, discontent and fears. The FN saw the increasing irritation of the working classes faced with immigration.
âWhen you are on high, well-placed, with a recognised status, the fact of being French doesnât add much and you can, as an intellectual exercise, consider yourself post-national or European. France is only where you were born. But when you at the bottom of the ladder, poor, in a precarious situation, all that remains is your country. National identity doesnât have the same significance for a bourgeois or for a proletariat,â de Closets added.
Bouvet argues that Hollandeâs government has hugely disappointed the working class by missing the opportunity to enact a âgreat symbolic social reformâ as previous Socialist administrations did with introducing retirement at 60 in 1980, a minimum social security allowance in 1988 and the 35-hour working week in 1997.
âWhat they were waiting for was a great fiscal reform, a redistribution, which is what Hollande had promised. And symbolically, instead of fiscal reform, taxes have gone up under the Socialists. This matters. Working-class people have said, look how the left governs, and they are disappointed, deceived.
âIâve been accused of doing the work of the FN, but for me itâs saying things that must be said. Itâs better to put these things on the table than sweep them under the carpet. Itâs better to air these things in order to fight the FN, which I believe is a danger for the republic.â
