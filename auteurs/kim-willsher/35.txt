In an additional blow to the veteran far-right politician, who caused a political row in 2002 when he won his way into the second round of the presidential elections, Le Pen faces being stripped of his role as honorary president of the party.FN members will be asked to vote on a definitive change of the partyâs rules at an extraordinary general assembly to be held within the next three months. In the interim, Le Penâs membership of the party has been suspended.
Le Pen had earlier stormed out of the FN headquarters after refusing to attend the disciplinary hearing. He said he had been âdisownedâ by his political family and that it was âbeneath his dignityâ to face FN officials when he was âperfectly innocentâ.
Le Pen was summoned to Mondayâs hearing after allegedly making racist and antisemitic remarks to the anger and dismay of his daughter Marine, the FN president, who has spent years trying to clean up its image. 
 He caused outrage by repeating his view that the Nazi gas chambers were just a âdetailâ of the second world war and saying he had never considered Marshal Philippe Pétain, leader of the collaborationist Vichy government, âa traitorâ. 
On Monday, hours after 
When FN officials took the opportunity to pass a motion condemning his proposals, he flounced out of the party headquarters at Nanterre on the outskirts of Paris and refused to attend the disciplinary hearing called for the afternoon.
 As he left, Le Pen, who is an MEP, told journalists: âThe honorary president, founder of the Front National, believes it is below his dignity to appear before a disciplinary panel when he considers he is perfectly innocent.
âI am acting in my role as a parliamentarian who is paid to speak. I am speaking on behalf of Jean-Marie Le Pen. I donât speak on behalf of the FN and havenât done for the last four years since Marine Le Pen became president of the FN.â 
 He responded furiously to his suspension from the FN on Monday night, which he described as a âfelonyâ, and threatened to take legal action. He also lashed out at Marine, the youngest of his three daughters, who he said he was disowning.
âI am ashamed that the president of the Front National has my name and I hope she loses it as soon as possible. She could either marry her concubine or Monsieur Philippot or anyone else. Iâd rather the president of the FN was no longer called Le Pen.
âShe can be Marine Aliot or Marine Philippot. It would be better. She has betrayed her father and the founder of the FN in an absolutely scandalous way.â
By âconcubineâ, Le Pen was referring to Marineâs partner, Louis Aliot, the vice president of the FN. Florian Philippot is another vice president of the party who has clashed publicly with Le Pen Sr. 
Party officials earlier expressed their âtotal confidenceâ in Marine Le Pen, estranged from her father after a series of public spats. She has called for on her father to retire from political life and some of the partyâs young guard suggested he could be excluded from the party he founded in 1972. Others said such a move was unthinkable and would, according to one who spoke to Le Monde, âopen the gates of Hellâ.
Aliot said Le Pen was disowning himself. He said: âHe is a member of the FN and he has to respect the rules. If he doesnât respect them, then heâs the one excluding himself from the FNâs political line.â
