The disgraced politician, forced to resign as head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after being arrested in New York and accused of sexually assaulting a hotel maid, said he was "shocked by the despicable and false" work.
Belle et Bête (a title that can be translated as Beauty and Beast or Beautiful and Stupid) was written by Marcela Iacub, who had a seven-month affair with Strauss-Kahn last year. It is due to be published on Wednesday.
In a court hearing on Tuesday morning, Strauss-Kahn, 63, often referred to as DSK, said he was "horrified" by the "dishonest" way in which his private life had been exposed by those with only "commercial interests" and claimed it was tantamount to "shooting a man who is already on the ground".
He claimed Iacub, 48, and her publisher Stock are guilty of an attack "on the intimacy of a private life", and wants a card saying as much inserted in each copy of the book as well as a ban on further distribution and damages.
In her explicit book, the Argentinian-born Iacub does not name Strauss-Kahn, but has publicly stated the protagonist featured in it is the former politician.
The court heard that she admitted, in an email to her former lover, that it "troubled" her conscience that she "had to make believe I was in love with you, mad about you". "I'm sorry," she concluded.
Strauss-Kahn told the court: "I am horrified by the means used to obtain this [book] â¦ is anything allowed in order to make money?"
He said the book had caused "devastation" to his private life, his family life and the "psychology of [his] children".
"I'm a very much out of my depth with this business," he admitted.
According to Jean Veil, his defence lawyer, DSK has suffered a "true manipulation â¦ and a real trap".
Books are rarely banned in In her book, extracts of which were published in last Thursday's edition of the left-of-centre news magazine Le Nouvel Observateur, Iacub recounts her relationship with Strauss-Kahn from January to August 2012, describing him as "half man, half pig".
In a letter to Jean Daniel, one of the founders of the weekly news magazine, DSK said he was "disgusted" and railed at the "behaviour of a woman who seduces in order to write a book, and who boasts about her amorous feelings in order to exploit them financially". He said it was an "operation that makes one sick".
As well as the ban, he is seeking â¬100,000 (£86,000) in damages and costs from Iacub and her publisher, and the same amount from Le Nouvel Observateur, which he also wants ordered to publish a full front-page apology.
Strauss-Kahn's estranged wife, the heiress and former television journalist Anne Sinclair, also wrote an open letter to Le Nouvel Observateur.
"How could you stoop so low? You have given credit to the manoeuvres of a perverse and dishonest women driven by her fascination for the sensational and the lure of money," she wrote.
Iacub visited Sinclair while writing the book, but did not tell her of her plans for the book.
"It wasn't a very loyal thing to do, but there were things I didn't understand about Dominique Strauss-Kahn's psychology â¦ the conversation with Anne Sinclair was fundamental.
"She was very kind, but I understood at what point she was convinced that she and her husband â because I remind you that they have still not divorced â are part of a caste of masters of the world.
"She said something, that I report in the book: "There's nothing wrong in getting a blow job from the cleaning woman." But for her, the world divides into masters and servants, between the dominant and the dominated, and it's normal. This terrified me a bit, as if we were still living in a society under the As he left the Palais de Justice in Paris on Tuesday, DSK said: "I just want one thing â to be left alone."
Strauss-Kahn was the Socialist party hopeful to become president when he was arrested in New York and accused of sexually assaulting a hotel cleaner, Nafissatou Diallo, in May 2011. He was later cleared of criminal charges after doubts were raised over the Guinean-born Diallo's credibility after she was found to have misled officials in her immigration claim. In December Strauss-Kahn was reported to have paid more than $1m (£650,000) to Diallo to settle a civil claim.
The former politician is under investigation for his role in the organisation of a vice ring involving a network of prostitutes in northern France. He denies any wrongdoing.
The court is expected to make its decision on the book at 19.30 (Central European Time) on Tuesday.
