Franceâs main commercial television channel, TF1, has dropped the Le Parisien newspaper said Wenger was âgreatly surprisedâ to learn his contract would not be renewed. However, other French media reported the decision had been made by âjoint agreementâ.
The Frenchman has commentated on matches involving the national team Les Bleus for the past 10 years.
The decision took effect immediately and Wenger was absent from TF1âs broadcast of the friendly between France and Spain at the Stade de France on Thursday evening.
Wenger, 64, from Alsace in eastern France, was a familiar face on TF1 at the Brazil World Cup and has regularly commentated on Champions League matches in recent years.
