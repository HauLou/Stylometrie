French luxury goods firm Hermès threw down the gauntlet â a hand-stitched top-grain leather one, of course â to rival Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy in 2010, it might have been hoping for a discreet, gentlemanly outcome. Instead, the challenge sparked years of public squabbling that in the refined circles inhabited by its wealthy clients could be defined as most ungenteel. Now, having raged for three years, the Gallic "handbag war" is entering a new phase.
In the next few weeks, the French authorities are expected to rule on the bitter dispute between the two firms. Did LVMH sneakily and with great subterfuge attempt a creeping takeover of Hermès when it obtained shares in the company using cash-settlement equity swaps and, it is claimed, subsidiaries? If so, it could face a fine of up to â¬10m.
Or has Hermès, anxious to remain family-run and independent, engaged in a snobbish and condescending "slander and smear" campaign against its bigger, brasher rival? If so, the company that referred to LVMH boss If the buoyant luxury goods market, which appears to be bucking the recession, was not so important to France's struggling economy, the handbags-at-dawn standoff between two of the country's most prestigious brands might be mildly amusing.
Its first customer may have been a horse, but Hermès has come a long way from its relatively humble beginnings as a harness and bridle shop for European nobles. This is the company that made scarves for Queen Elizabeth II and Jackie Onassisâ who decorated her walls with them â and boots for the former shah of Iran, and created the once-ubiquitous "Kelly" bag, named for Princess Grace of Monaco.
Hermès, which has gone from strength to strength in recent years, and posted a record-breaking profit of â¬740m in 2012, on a â¬3.48bn turnover, is also purveyor of the ultimate "it" bag, the Birkin â named after British singer Jane Birkin â whose price can match that of a luxury car and whose exclusiveness has survived reports that queen of bling Victoria Beckham has 100 of them in her closet.
Not that Hermès talks about its customers. For a firm that considers its hand-stitched, hand-crafted goods the always had a condescending view of Louis Vuitton and its bags of coated canvas".
Asked once why Hermès shunned initials, Xavier Guerrand-Hermès, great-great-grandson of Thierry Hermès, who opened the first harness shop in Paris in 1837, retorted: "If someone knows us, they will know us."
To the Hermès clan, LVMH is a brash upstart, as is Arnault, a close friend of former president Nicolas Sarkozy, also viewed as a parvenu. The stable of firms in Arnault's empire, acquired often by snapping up small, dispute-riven companies, includes Moët & Chandon, the world's largest champagne house, as well as Givenchy, Guerlain, Marc Jacobs and Céline.
In 2010, when the French stock-market watchdog, the AMF, announced its investigation into how Arnault acquired his 17% of Hermès shares, it warned it would be "long, difficult and very complex". The inquiry has sparked three years of claims and counter-claims between the luxury giants.
A leaked AMF report carried in Last July, Hermès launched a lawsuit "Patrick Thomas, joint chief executive of Hermès, told French journalists that LVMH's emergence as a shareholder was neither "desired, nor desirable" and was against stock exchange rules: "The small Hermès shareholders would not have sold [their shares] had they known LVMH was behind the attack." At a final hearing at the end of May, the two sides were still slugging it out. The AMF's decision is expected by the end of June.
Thomas, who will hand over the reins to Axel Dumas, 42, a sixth-generation member of the Hermès family, told French news channel BFMTV: "We must not have someone who is a rival and perhaps a threat holding too-significant capital. From the beginning we have said that the way that LVMH got into Hermès is, and I'm measuring my words, illicit." Thomas has even suggested that LVMH's withdrawal from Hermès is "in the interests of France".

LVMH has repeatedly argued that its actions were perfectly legal. Vice-president Pierre Godé said: "It is not for a publicly listed company to ask whether it likes its shareholders or not. LVMH is a shareholder and asks to be treated like any other."
