At least two people died when a four-storey building in the eastern Paris suburb of Rosny-sous-Bois was destroyed by a massive explosion on Sunday morning.
Another 11 people were injured, four of them seriously, and fire officers using sniffer dogs searched the rubble of the property for nine residents, including two children, reported missing.
The victims were an eight-year-old child and an 80-year-old woman who died as she was being pulled out of the destroyed block of flats..
"We're hoping to find the [missing] victims alive," Col Bernard Tourneur, leading the rescue operation, told AFP. He said the search could take up to 48 hours and that rescuers were ringing the mobile phones of those thought to be in the rubble in the hope of hearing them ring.
The explosion happened about 7am and is believed to have been caused by a gas leak.
Maryline Yvon, a resident of a neighbouring building, told reporters workmen from the gas and electricity utility company recently dug up the pavement in front of the building. "Seeing the force of the explosion it wasn't caused by a bottle of gas, that's for sure," Yvon, 49, said.
The building, constructed in the 1970s, was "in a perfect condition" and had been properly maintained, the local prefect, Philippe Galli said.
Police have opened an inquiry.
