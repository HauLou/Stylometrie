An Anglo-American expatriate couple who moved to France to breed dachshunds have been found shot dead in their home in the southwest of American-born Derrick Hawkins, 98, is thought to have shot his 86-year-old British wife Sheila dead before turning the 0.22-calibre rifle on himself.
The bodies of the couple were discovered by their cleaning lady on Monday morning at their home outside the village of Fabas, near Toulouse, where they ran a breeding business called Long Meadow. La Depeche du Midi, the local newspaper, reported that Hawkins had recently told his physiotherapist that he was âmorally tiredâ adding: âif I go, it wonât be alone.â
A postmortem examination will be held in Toulouse on Wednesday.
Géraldine Labialle, the deputy prosecutor, told La Depeche the murder-suicide theory seemed to be the most likely. There was no evidence of a struggle in the house, she added.
Simon Bavard, Fabas mayor, told the paper the Hawkins couple, who were passionate about dog breeding, were well known in the village of just 390 residents, and that locals were totally shocked by their deaths.
