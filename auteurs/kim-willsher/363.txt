When French theatre director Jean-Luc Choplin decided to bring My Fair Lady to the Paris stage, he was faced with a linguistic conundrum.
"How do you translate 'the rain in Spain stays mainly on the plain'?" he said. "I mean, you can come up with something in French but it doesn't have the same clarity or sonority.
"It's not bad, it's just not the same thing. And it's such an important part of the play."
Rather than a Gallic version of Professor Higgins' famous phonetics course, which included the equally untranslatable: "In Hertford, Hereford and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly ever happen", Choplin made a high-risk decision to stage My Fair Lady in the original English.
The risk paid off, My Fair Lady crossed the cultural divide and the theatre's 27-show run in 2010 was a sellout.
Now Choplin is having another go at the classic musical, again in English with French subtitles. "It works because people know the original musical, which was followed by the film with Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn and it's a great family classic so it's wonderful for Christmas," he said, sitting in the grand meeting room at the Châtelet Theatre in central Paris."Everybody loves a good fairy story; the princess, or in this case the flower seller who goes on to become a real lady. But there's much more to the story than that."
"My Fair Lady is a charming, seductive work. It is a much more serious than it seems. There are many levels of complexity and the story is universal. In it we see the class structure in that era in England and how language really is an obstacle to social access. It's also about change in England that at the time was become more industrial and opening out to the world.
"Of course it's not entirely saccharine and magic and this production is certainly not a little light music. We have an exceptional cast and a 40-strong orchestra in the pit so we have opera-like quality. Audiences aren't stupid, they know when something is artistically good â¦ and when it is not."
The original musical, based on George Bernard Shaw's 1912 play Pygmalion, starred Rex Harrison as phoneticist Professor Henry Higgins, who takes the Cockney sparrow Eliza Doolittle, played by Julie Andrews, under his wing, promising to make her talk like a true lady.
Since taking over as director general of the Châtelet in 2004, Choplin, a former chief executive of Sadler's Wells in London and vice-president of Disneyland, Paris, who was after he was appointed by Paris mayor Bertrand Delanoë, has made staging emblematic Broadway musicals â including the Sound of Music in English â something of a speciality.
Next year he will oversee a production of An American in Paris at the Châtelet. "I never had a single letter of complaint about productions in English except when we did Les Misérables and a very angry person wrote to ask how we dared put [Victor] Hugo on in English," he said.
"I say it's a good thing that French literature travels and is known around the world.
"And putting on shows in English raises the curiosity of the French public that has a thirst for something new, something international."
He added: "My Fair Lady is a great piece. It's positive, intelligent and the text and music are brilliant. What more could you ask for?
"At a time of gloominess and economic crisis we have to get out, escape reality and dream and My Fair Lady is both light and profound; its spirit goes straight to the heart.
"It's not about forgetting, it's about making people realise life is not just about Choplin said the audiences for the Paris show were 85% French-speaking and the rest Anglophones. And he insisted they all get the plot.
"Sometimes there's a slight hitch with the subtitles going a bit slow and arriving long after the joke so the French are sitting there wondering why the Anglo-Saxons are roaring their heads off. And sometimes it's fast and they have the punchline before it's delivered.

"But that's life and it's part of the charm of a production."
