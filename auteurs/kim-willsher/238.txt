Children in agricultural areas are being exposed to a dangerous cocktail of pesticides, some of which are banned substances, a French health and environment group has claimed.
Générations Futures did independent analysis of the hair of young people living or studying near farms and vineyards after parents expressed worries about their children being exposed to poisons that could disrupt their endocrine system.
The group, a non-profit organisation specialising in the use and effects of pesticides on humans and the environment, says its findings confirmed their fears.
Researchers took hair samples from a selected group of children aged between three and 10 living or attending schools between 50 and 200 metres from different agricultural zones. It sent the samples to an independent laboratory in Luxembourg that used methods similar to those employed by detectives investigating poisoning cases.
In 29 samples tested 624 pesticide traces were found, suggesting that 80% of the children had been exposed to agricultural pesticides in the previous three months. The laboratory found traces of 53 pesticides believed to affect mammals' hormone systems and capable of causing cancerous tumours, birth defects, developmental disorders and learning disabilities in humans.
An average of 21.52 distinct pesticides were found in each child; 35 endocrine disruptor pesticides were found at least once, while 13 types of pesticides were discovered in all the hair samples.
Just under three-quarters of the children ate organic food regularly, so the contamination likely came from an outside source, not their food.
"The presence of more than 21 pesticides, on average, that are endocrine disruptors in the hair that was analysed shows that our children are exposed to a significant cocktail of these substances," said François Veillerette, spokesperson for Générations Futures. "Now the European commission must finally publish a clear and protective definition of the endocrine disruptors that have to be banned."
The group's report urged action. "Our demand is simple and based on an ambitious goal: no organism should contain endocrine disruptors, in order to protect the health of unborn children."
Générations Futures said the French government's national strategy to deal with endocrine disruptors had hit a dead end. The plan originally was to be published in 2013 but had been repeatedly postponed â now it was to be at the end of April.
"Because children are part of the population especially vulnerable to the dangers of endocrine disruptors, they should not be exposed to them," it said.
The research showed several children were exposed to harmful chemicals banned for agricultural use but still used in parasite treatments for pets.
Jean-Charles Bocquet, director of the European Association of Plant Protection Product Manufacturers, dismissed the research. "The presence of pesticide traces is not necessarily indicative of a health danger, especially in infinitely small doses. I'm sure you'd find traces of diesel in our hair if you looked for it," he told Le Parisien.
Veillerette disagreed. "It's not the dose that's the problem, but the accumulation of pesticides causing a cocktail effect."
Générations Futures said it had sent its findings to a specialised university research team for further analysis.
