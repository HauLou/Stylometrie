It is one of the great allegorical paintings celebrating the French revolution: Liberty Leading the People, by Eugène Delacroix, shows a barefoot, bare-breasted woman â representing Marianne, the female symbol of the republic â brandishing a tricolour in one hand and a bayonetted musket in the other, leading the people over the bodies of the fallen.
Pupils at the French Lycée in A few pages on, another allegorical revolutionary painting, La Vérité Amène la République et lâAbondance (Truth Bringing the Republic and Abundance) by Nicolas de Courteille, has been given a similar dressing down â or dressing up â with another judiciously placed sticker.Pupils opening their science books to the chapter, âtransformations linked to pubertyâ and âhow the female reproductive organs workâ will find the human bodies crudely effaced with a black felt-tipped pen and illustrations of reproducing animals scribbled over. Drawings of the male anatomy have not been defaced, though.
Franceâs ministry of education, which is responsible for ensuring all schools study the same approved list of text books, insisted there was nothing it could do. âAll French establishments abroad are subject to the laws of the countries in which they are established, unlike embassies and consulates, â a spokesperson told Le Monde.
âObviously they have to work with the social and political reality of each country. Thereâs no obligation to use the textbooks that are just there to support the work of the teachers.â The wielders of the black pens came from somewhere within the ministry of education in Kuwait City, the paper said.The French Lycée in Kuwait City opened in 1988 and has 1,350 pupils, about 13% of them French, and the rest either local children or the children of expats of various nationalities. It is a private school that comes under the foreign and education ministries in Paris and is regarded as an official âpartner establishmentâ. 
Under article 2 of French regulations, such educational establishments must offer teaching âsimilar to that offered in Peter Gumbel, a writer on education and a professor at Parisâs prestigious Institut dâetudes Politiques, known as Sciences Po, admitted the censorship was surprising in the wake of the rush to uphold republican values after the January attacks on Charlie Hebdo newspaper and a Jewish supermarket in Paris.However, he said it was part of Franceâs realpolitik approach to foreign policy. âThe French do this kind of soft diplomacy through schools and culture very well. Itâs a grotesque irony that after Charlie Hebdo and the defiant call for repbulican values and standing up for freedom, but itâs a classic clash of different interests and the foreign office has clearly won this battle.â
Delacroixâs painting, which hangs in the Louvre, is credited with influencing Victor Hugoâs novel Les Misérables and inspiring the Statue of Liberty, a gift from the French to New York. The Louvre, which is due to open a â¬500m (£362m) museum in the United Arab Emirates capital, Abu Dhabi, in December, is expected to face similar problems from the countryâs conservative authorities.

However, museum officials insist the UAE has not censored any nudity or religious symbolism in the works going on display. These include a Jewish Torah from Yemen, an ancient Hindu statue, a Buddha and works evoking African animism, according to art experts. âNo work has been refused,â a source told AFP
Sophie Grange, a spokeswoman for the Louvre, insisted the Abu Dhabi museum was not simply a branch of the French museum but independent and it was up to the UAE to decide what was put on display.
Titianâs fully-clothed but voluptuous Woman with a Mirror will be among the paintings sent to Abu Dhabi from the Paris Louvre. The emirati museum has also acquired an unseen portrait by Pablo Picasso called Portrait of a Lady, that is unlikely to raise any embarrassed eyebrows.
In September last year, the UN criticised the US for âwidespread censorshipâ in prisons and schools, revealing that books containing the work of Cézanne, Picasso and Van Gogh, among many others, are banned from Texan state prisons for containing âsexually explicit imagesâ.
In May, a local Fox news station in the US was accused of being âsexually sickâ by art critics after blurring the breasts in Pablo Picassoâs cubist painting Women of Algiers, when reporting its record-breaking sale.
Also in May, western authors were warned about the censorship of politically and sexuality sensitive subjects in Chinese translations of their work, with the Pen American Centre reporting that many of the expurgations currently occur without the authorâs knowledge.
