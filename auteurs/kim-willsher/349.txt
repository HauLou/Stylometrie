Pablo Picasso's masterpieces can fetch millions. On Wednesday night, however, one lucky art lover took possession of an original work â conservatively valued at â¬1m (£845,000) â for a comparatively modest outlay of â¬100.
L'Homme au Gibus (Man with Opera Hat), a gouache on paper work measuring 30.5cm by 24cm, was disposed of by tombola at the Sotheby's auction house in Paris. It is the first time a work by a major painter has been offered in such a way.
Money raised from the sale of raffle tickets, 50,000 of which have been available online since April, will go towards helping the ancient Phoenician city of Tyre, in southern Lebanon, a Unesco world heritage site that was severely damaged during the Lebanese civil war in the 1970s and 1980s and has also been threatened by growing urban development.
Olivier Picasso, the artist's grandson, and Péri Cochin, a French journalist of Iraqi and Lebanese descent, came up with the idea as an alternative to "boring" fundraising gala dinners.
"This is a very important drawing because it first stands witness to the cubist work carried out by my grandfather," said Picasso, son of Maya, the artist's daughter by his mistress Marie-Thérèse Walter.
He said his grandfather, who died in 1973, would have approved. "He would have been amused to participate in an event like this." He said the work, signed by the artist in the top right corner, was "beautiful and perfectly executed. And the subject is a character."
Cochin said it was a novel way to raise funds for a good cause. "When my mother said let's do another gala, I said 'oh no please don't do this again'. It's always the same kind of people at the table, looking at their watches," Cochin told USA Today when the picture went on display in New York. She said a raffle would "reach a wider target of people than usual, people who have never heard of us before".
Picasso, 52, who works as a French TV producer and art consultant to the Picasso family foundation, said the estate was waiving its usual fees for the sale of Picasso artworks.
