The late great French film director François Truffaut once declared damningly that the words "British" and "cinema" were incompatible. It was, he remarked, curious that "considering the high intellectual level â¦ and the universal stature" of British writers and poets, little cinematic work (apart from movies by Alfred Hitchcock and Charlie Chaplin) had stood the test of time.
Until recently the feeling has been mutual. British cinemagoers have largely shunned subtitled French films (unlike our Gallic neighbours, we don't like dubbed movies), shoving them into a dark niche explored by only the most devoted cinephile.
Pressed to name a dozen, most people would struggle to get past the feelgood 2001 film But for the last eight years, the French film industry has gently wooed and successfully seduced a growing number of British movie fans. As a result Gallic cinema is fast becoming a box office success, most recently with Abdellatif Kechiche's hit, Next year will see a record number of French-made films in British cinemas, starring among others Juliette Binoche, Audrey Tautou and Helena Bonham-Carter. In Another 2014 treat will be The boom is relatively recent. In its last report produced in 2012, uniFrance, a government-funded organisation aimed at promoting French films abroad, admitted: "The United Kingdom is a difficult market for 'non-English' language films. Up until 2005, French cinema had never had more than 1% of the market and 1.5m ticket sales. Since then, largely thanks to major productions in English, we see a positive evolution."
By 2011 the market had risen to 1.8%, with just over 3.1m ticket sales and 49 films. The most successful was The next year saw French cinema in the UK explode, with 72 films attracting nearly eight million people. Attendance at French-language and French-made films rose by 157% on the previous year. UniFrance said that figures for 2013 had not yet been calculated, but were higher still. In 2014, the French cultural exception will be even more exceptional across the Channel.
The rise is not due just to the increasing number of French people living in the UK â particularly London which, with around 600,000 nationals, has been described as the 21st arrondissement of Paris â but by a number of high-quality films that have attracted audiences in Manchester, Glasgow and Liverpool.
"This really is the time for French film-makers. What has happened over the last year and a half is that France has produced some extremely high-quality films that have been both critical and commercial hits," Jason Wood, the director of programming at Curzon cinemas, which screens many European and arthouse films, told the BBC in May.
Wood cited Charlotte Saluard, director of programming at Ciné Lumière in London, told the BBC: "Big film distributors are now willing to try their luck, which frees these films from being seen as just for a 'niche' market."
In "French cinema, however, appears to undergo a transformation as it reaches Britain, becoming something quite different to that experienced by audiences at home."However, Lucy Mazdon, professor film at Southampton University, told the "They have repackaged it in recent years and it has slightly emerged from that stereotype due to concerted efforts to make French films more popular and populist. There is an opening up, but I suspect it's the same people going to art houses and seeing the films, just doing so more often.
"A French film remains defined by the fact it is in French and it's success in Britain is still a bit hit and miss. It's no surprise that one of the most successful French films of recent years was
