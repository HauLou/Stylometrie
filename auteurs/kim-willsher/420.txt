Anne Hidalgo rushes into her enormous city hall office apologising profusely for being all of five minutes late. "I'm sorry, I hate being late," she says.
This is a surprise; attention to time-keeping is hardly de rigueur in "Perhaps I'm a little English then," the Spanish-born, French-adopted Hidalgo adds, clearly amused at the thought. In fact, Hidalgo's influences are even wider spread: her retired parents live in southern Spain and her older sister lives in California and is married to "an Englishman" â who it turns out is from Wales.
"They're all coming to Paris at the end of the month along with my brother-in-law's parents, which should be interesting," she says. (Even more so, I fear, if she keeps referring to said brother-in-law as English).
But if Hidalgo can talk her way out of a furious crowd of nimbys opposed to Socialist plans to build council houses in their posh Paris neighbourhood, the Welsh in-laws will be a pushover.
Hidalgo, 53, insists that she prefers dialogue and debate to confrontation. Today, however, she is gearing up for a political fight and feels "combative".
Next year she will ask Parisians to elect her as the city's mayor. As she and her nearest rival â the ambitious former centre-right government minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet â are both women, it is a pretty good bet that Paris's city hall will have a Madame le Maire in 2014 for the first time.
Hidalgo believes that the French capital is ready for such an egalitarian leap, but not by default or quotas. She subscribes, she says, to the "French feminist tradition of equality between the sexes â not the Anglo-Saxon feminist belief that women are better than men".
"It's about teams working better when they better represent society in terms of gender." It is also about providing creche places, childcare and giving women a chance to work, she says. The launch of her campaign earlier this month at Paris's trendy Bataclan nightclub saw the petite Hidalgo mobbed by supporters to the sounds of the Rolling Stones' Harlem Shuffle. It was a curious choice of music. "You move it to the left â¦ you move it to the right," sings Mick Jagger.
Hidalgo's impeccable socialist and republican credentials leave no room for such sway. Her maternal grandfather, Antonio, fled General Franco's fascist zone in Spain in 1937, crossing the Pyrenees with his family on a donkey. Homesick, he returned two years later, widowed â his wife did not survive the return journey â and with four dependent children. He was promptly thrown into jail and given a double death sentence, later commuted to life imprisonment, and freed after three years.
His children, including Anne's father, also Antonio, then aged 10, were outcast as "children of the reds" in their home town of San Fernando near Cádiz, where Anne was born.
After joining the Spanish merchant navy, where he trained as an electrician, Antonio junior, his wife Marie, and their two daughters aged two and four, settled in Lyon in 1961.
"My father knew She had a tough but happy childhood, she says, with "loving parents and an open house". Her mother, a seamstress, made mostly pretty dresses for her girls, who were always impeccably turned out.
The French language and state schools were the common factors that united the eclectic émigré community, and both Anne and her sister flourished. "In the playground, the political debates were lively. This impassioned me. We celebrated the death of Franco in 1975," she writes.
Graduating with degrees in social work and law, Anne headed for Paris and a job as a works' inspector. Later she worked in a series of ministerial offices under the Socialist prime minister Lionel Jospin in the 1990s, before joining the newly elected Socialist mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delanoë, at city hall as his deputy in 2001.
As a working mother â she has a grown-up son and daughter from a first marriage, and an 11-year-old son from her second â she says she understands the conflicting tug of careers and children. One of the many photographs in her office shows her youngest boy as an unexpected guest at an official ceremony at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier. "I have been known to bring my children into the office if all else fails," she says.
"It's all about prioritising. If the school calls, and there's an accident, of course I go straight away. If it's a fever, I negotiate or call on friends. It's not easy, but what I don't do is feel guilty.
"The time I spend with my children is important time, but it's also good for them to know I am happy doing what I do, and that is important too."
Friends and colleagues have described her as a fighter and "an iron fist in a velvet glove". Critics of her, as Delanoë's anointed successor, have nicknamed her the "heiress". The waspish former first lady, Bernadette Chirac, who supports Kosciusko-Morizet and whose husband Jacques was mayor of Paris for 18 years, has taken to calling Hidalgo "that woman with the dark hair".
Hidalgo cheerfully accepts the slings and arrows with a laugh and a shrug. "When I first entered politics, my daughter said she was upset when she saw posters of me defaced in the street. She said it made her feel bad. So I found a poster and told her to do her worst with it.
"Afterwards, I said: 'See, I'm still here, nothing bad has happened.'"
She says that she can be authoritarian, but only as a last resort.
She works mostly by instinct, she adds. Of the Bataclan campaign launch, she is annoyed with herself for not following that instinct and addressing the crowd unscripted. "I wish I'd done it without notes. I won't use notes the next time," she says.
Until now, Hidalgo has perhaps most closely been associated with Paris's successful free bicycle scheme Vélib', and with attempts to reduce car use and consequent pollution in the city. Her election programme, to be officially launched later this year, is a mixed bag including the creation of 60,000 new homes; encouraging business startups; reducing speed limits around schools; renovating emblematic city squares; and more culture and free Wi-Fi throughout the city.
The city hall post is often viewed as a springboard to the Élysée Palace. But for Hidalgo, who came to Paris aged 24 so that she could "meet Sartre", it is the "dream job of dream jobs".
"This isn't about what Paris can do for my career. This is about what I can do for Paris and the Parisians," she tells the "And the people of Paris are not easily fooled; they can see when someone is using them as opposed to serving them, and it's not what they want.
"Paris is still my city of dreams. I will never leave here. And being mayor of Paris is the best elected job that exists."
