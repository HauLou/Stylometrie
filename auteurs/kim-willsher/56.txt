Leaders and representatives of 30 European cities will gather in Paris on Thursday to declare their commitment to âcleanâ policies to fight climate change.
Officials will also sign a declaration agreeing to use their collective purchasing power â estimated at around â¬10bn (£7.4bn) a year â to buy eco-friendly.

The gathering comes eight months before Paris hosts the United Nations climate change conference, known as COP21, aimed at achieving a binding, universal and international agreement on climate for the first time in more than 20 years of UN negotiations.
In a joint statement signed by 26 European mayors, including Londonâs Boris Johnson, city representatives said they hoped combining forces to favour green and low-carbon industries for procurement contracts would have a âleverage effect on the private sector that very often aligns its own requirements with the public sectorâ.
â[The] time has now come for European capitals and metropolises to pool our efforts to tackle climate change. This requires a closer dialogue between cities through a more regular exchange of expertise and good practices,â they declared.
The mayors will arrive at Parisâ city hall in electric Autolibâ cars, from the cityâs car-sharing service, decorated in the colours of their country.The summit comes a week after Paris was declared the most polluted city on the planet after a choking cloud almost obscured its most symbolic monuments including the Eiffel Tower and left the city of light looking more like the capital of smog.
