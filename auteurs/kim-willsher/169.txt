The bodies of five French climbers have been found and a sixth mountaineer is missing on Mont Blanc, bringing the death toll on the Alpine mountain to 13 in less than a month.
The group of five â four men and one woman â attached to one cord and led by an experienced guide â was ascending the Aiguille d'Argentière (Argentière's Needle) on Europe's highest mountain when they were reportedly caught by bad weather on Tuesday evening.
When they failed to arrive at a mountain refuge as planned, the alarm was raised. A rescue helicopter was unable to take off immediately on Tuesday because of the worsening weather. On Wednesday morning, the mountain gendarmerie discovered the bodies of five climbers, aged between 27 and 45.
The group was taking part in a two-week mountaineering course organised by the Union Nationale des Centres Sportifs de Plein Air (UCPA).
The Aiguille d'Argentière, which is 3,901 meters high, is part of the Mont Blanc range in the Haute-Savoie region on one side and the Swiss canton of Valais on the other.
In just two weeks, between 15 July and 30 July, six climbers died on Mont Blanc: two Irish, two Finnish, one German and one French. Two Belgian mountaineers were found dead on 2 August.
Professional guides fear the Mont Blanc massif, nicknamed the 'roof of Europe' or 'la Dame blanche' (the white lady), is becoming a free-for-all with tourists, some of whom are reckless.
In summer up to 400 people set off to climb the mountains every day; a study done by the mountain authorities suggested a total of between 25,000 and 30,000 people attempted to conquer the summit.
A week ago, mountain gendarmes intercepted an Austrian climber at 3,200 meters on Mont-Blanc who was trying to ascend with his five-year-old son and had reached an altitude where the temperature was minus 20C and the winds around 150kmph.
"What was awful was that the gendarmes were forced to argue with the man to convince him to turn around. We're not even sure that he won't make another attempt," said Jean-Marc Peillex, mayor of nearby St-Gervais-les-Bains.
Last month, an American climber who filmed his children aged 11 and nine being knocked off their feet in a mini-avalanche as they tried to set a new mountaineering record was condemned by local officials.
Patrick Sweeney, a self-confessed "adrenaline junkie" filmed his son PJ and daughter Shannon on the mountain's notorious "corridor of death" and put it on YouTube.
At the time, Peillex accused Sweeney of recklessness and said Mont Blanc was becoming "an amusement park where we're going to have gendarmes, rescuers and Pamela Anderson to save us."
L'Aiguille d'Argentière boasts the six-kilometre-long Saleina glacier on its north-eastern side, and the Milieu glacier on its south-western side, running between two tall and narrow peaks. There are various possible ascents, posing different challenges including rocks, snow, ice and needles and ranging from slightly to extremely difficult according to climbing classifications.
