François Hollande's official partner, Valérie Trierweiler, is to remain in hospital "for an indeterminate time" until doctors decide she has recovered from the shock of discovering his alleged infidelity.
Trierweiler, 48, was taken to hospital on Friday suffering from what was described as "a severe case of blues", hours after a French magazine published photographs of the president apparently paying secret visits to an actress.
She was expected to be discharged, but her office announced she would remain in hospital because she was "still in need of a rest".
"The doctors say she needs more rest and they will decide when she will be able to leave," a spokesperson for her office at the Elysée Palace told Reuters. "She needs some peace."
Concerns about Trierweiler, who has been called France's First Girlfriend, and the scandal over Hollande's alleged relationship with Julie Gayet, 41, threaten to overshadow a planned press conference on Tuesday at which Hollande, 59, is due to announce how he intends to address France's economic woes, including high unemployment and low growth, in the next 12 months.
The occasion was also to serve as the traditional presidential new year good wishes to the press, no doubt the last people he now wishes to meet and greet after the celebrity magazine Closer revealed that he had been scootering across Paris for secret overnight trysts with Gayet.
Trierweiler has made no comment about the affair. Le Parisien reported on Monday she was ready to forgive Hollande but wanted to know "his intentions".
Le Parisien journalist Frédéric Gerschel, said to be close to Trierweiler, quoted a friend in his article, but Le Figaro reported that the "friend" was Trierweiler talking off the record.
Gerschel said Hollande had confessed to her face to face on Thursday evening, hours before Closer hit the news stands.
"The scene took place in the Elysée without blows or shouting. In a few words, the president acknowledged the existence of it [the affair].
"He denied nothing, not the escapades on his scooter with his bodyguard in the middle of the night, nor the frequency of the secret meetings, or the date when this 'love affair', as the foreign press has baptised it, started, several months previously," Gerschel wrote.
"After this explanation, that one imagines was delicate, the couple gave themselves a few days to reflect before clarifying the situation in the eyes of [public] opinion. This affair that should have remained private has quickly spilled out into the public domain. It's a veritable political-romantic tsunami."
Le Parisien quoted a friend as saying Hollande's confession of infidelity had struck Trierweiler "like a TGV hitting the buffers", adding: "Of course she'd heard the rumours that have been going around Paris for the past few weeks, but she chose to believe they were false. For her, they were always a couple."
Trierweiler had little cause for suspicion, the paper added, as the couple had spent New Year's Eve with her at La Lanterne, a presidential retreat in the grounds of the Versailles Palace, and had joined the Trierweiler family for Boxing Day.
Closer had claimed he spent the nights either side of the New Year with Gayet.
The Parisien source scotched rumours that the presidential couple had become estranged. "They are not living in separate wings of the Elysée as some have claimed. Despite the difficulties, they have had a long relationship and to see this splashed all over the front pages is quite violent."
The paper said there was no suggestion that Trierweiler had tried to harm herself, and that she had been taken to hospital as a "preventive measure". Trierweiler's advisers at the Elysée, where she has an office and small staff, say difficult decisions will have to be taken "rapidly". She is due to accompany the president on a visit to the US to meet Barack Obama on 11 February.
"She seems ready to forgive him, she doesn't want to slam the door in a huff, but she wants to know quickly what François Hollande's intentions are," a close friend told Le Parisien.
Hollande's advisers are said to be furious that news of her hospitalisation had leaked, believing it to be an attempt at "emotional blackmail".
Gerschel said Trierweiler realised her status needed "clarification" as she has an office at the Elysée, along with other state-funded perks, but no official role.
Earlier, the scandal took an unexpectedly sinister turn with claims â and denials â that the flat used for the president's meetings with Gayet was linked to the Corsican mafia.
French media reported that the apartment was loaned to the actor by a friend who was involved with two mobsters with connections on the crime hit Mediterranean island.
However the friend, Emmanuelle Hauck, denied that her ex husband Michel Ferracci, who was given an 18-month suspended sentence in connection with a money-laundering last November, had ever owned, rented or lived in the property and threatened to sue for defamation.
It was later revealed that after splitting from Ferracci, Hauck lived with François Masini who was shot dead last May in an apparent gangland killing.
The actual owner of the apartment, a 71-year-old pensioner living in Biarritz, said he was "extremely shocked" by the goings on at his property and was consulting his lawyers.
Hollande is expected to divert attempts to hijack Tuesday's press conference with questions about the scandal by making a brief statement referring to it, then refusing to comment further, arguing that the French are more interested in serious issues including the economy and employment.
Le Figaro said it was essential for Hollande to address public spending, fiscal reform, schemes to reduce unemployment and the conflict in the Central African Republic, where
