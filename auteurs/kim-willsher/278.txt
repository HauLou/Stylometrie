The French former president The decision on Tuesday by the cour de cassation, the highest appeal court in the country, paves the way for the documents to be used in investigations into the former leader.
It comes as a blow to Sarkozy, who has been dropping increasingly heavy hints that he will stand again for election in 2017. He lost the 2012 president election after just one term in office, to Socialist rival François Hollande.
The diaries, covering 2007-11, were originally removed by investigators looking into whether Sarkozy and his centre-right UMP party received illegal campaign donations from France's richest woman and one of L'Oréal's principal shareholders, Liliane Bettencourt. Judges decided in October that Sarkozy had no case to answer in what had become known as the Bettencourt affair.

Sarkozy's lawyer had argued that the seizure of the diaries was against the French constitution, which protects French president's from prosecution during their time in office.
