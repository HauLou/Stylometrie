Four French journalists released from captivity in Didier François, Nicolas Hénin, Edouard Elias and Pierre Torres were met by their overjoyed families and François Hollande on their return to After arriving at Villacoublay military airport near Paris on Sunday morning, François, 53, said the conditions of their detention had been "rough â¦ and sometimes violent". He told reporters it was "a great joy and an immense relief, obviously, to be free. Under the sky, which we haven't seen for a long time, to breathe the fresh air, to walk freely. It was a long haul, but we never lost hope," he added. "From time to time, we got snatches of information; we knew that the world was mobilised."
He told His colleague Nicolas Hénin added that the hostages had been "plunged into the Syria chaos in the absolute sense of the term." Hénin had tried to escape shortly after he was kidnapped, but was caught after 24 hours.
François, a veteran war correspondent, and Elias, a photographer, were abducted in early June last year on their way to Aleppo. Hénin, who was working for Le Point magazine, and Torres, reporting for French-German television channel Arte, were taken later that month near Raqqa.
After being briefly reunited with their families the four men were taken for medical examinations and debriefing by France's intelligence services, who claimed to have known throughout where the hostages were being held. France's intelligence operatives said on Sunday they had worked closely with colleagues from Britain, Spain, America and Turkey.
The hostages were found by Turkish soldiers in a no-man's land on the Syrian border late on Friday. They had been blindfolded and handcuffed, and looked haggard and unkempt but in reasonably good health. The jihadist group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has been accused of kidnapping them.
Hollande insisted France had not paid a ransom for the men's release but said negotiations with their kidnappers had been going on for several weeks. Hollande said: "The state does not pay ransoms. It's a very important principle so the kidnappers are not tempted to take other hostages. Everything was done by negotiation, discussions. I don't want to give more details because we still have two other hostages [in Sahel]," he added.
The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, strongly denied that weapons had been sent to the hostage takers. Hollande said it was a "day of great joy" not just for the men's families but for the whole country. "France is proud to have compatriots of this quality who work for the freedom of the press. And France is proud to have been able to secure their release," Hollande said. "But there are still hostages in Syria being held because they are journalists."
Hollande also said France had information that the government of Bashar al-Assad was still using chemical weapons on its people. However, he said he had no proof of this.
The Assad regime is supposedly handing over all its chemical weapons.
