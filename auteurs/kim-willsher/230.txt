France's economy minister Arnaud Montebourg flew to Berlin on Friday to urge Siemens to make a counterbid for the energy division of Alstom and keep the business out of the hands of its US suitor, General Electric (GE).

It also forced Alstom's management to accept a one-month period of reflection during which other bids could be considered.
At the time, Siemens said it had written to the Alstom board "to signal its willingness to discuss future strategic opportunities", but two weeks later no formal offer has been made.

"The two companies have major strategy differences â¦ and besides, they don't even like each other very much," he said. "Montebourg vaunts the idea of economic patriotism. In short this means:
