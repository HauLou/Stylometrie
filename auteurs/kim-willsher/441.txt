The head of Stéphane Richard said he would reduce his annual salary to below â¬1m (£855,000), the level at which the proposed tax would be applied, to save the company from having to pay it.
The tax, one of President François Hollande's key election pledges, is aimed at soothing public anger at perceived fat cat salaries at a time of high unemployment and economic belt-tightening among the general population.
However, it has angered big business leaders who claim they are bearing the brunt of reforms intended to rein in France's public deficit.
After France's highest court threw out a plan to impose the 75% rate on individuals at the end of last year, Hollande vowed to make firms pay it instead.
Richard told the centre-right newspaper Le Figaro: "If the law is adopted â¦ I will make sure my pay is reduced below the â¬1m mark. I wouldn't want France Télécom to have to pay this tax on my salary."
Richard is the first head of a state-backed company to make the stand. France Télécom, which is 27% public-owned, paid Richard a fixed salary of â¬900,000 (£769,000) last year with a performance-based bonus of â¬600,000 (£512,000). He is due to be paid the same salary and bonus in 2013.
Richard was chief of staff to the finance minister Christine Lagarde â now head of the International Monetary Fund - under Hollande's predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy. His France Télécom salary is reportedly the 37th highest among the companies listed on France's CAC 40 stock exchange.
