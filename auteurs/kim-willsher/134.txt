Since the French Revolution, Parisâs Val-de-Grâce military hospital has offered healthcare to the worldâs best connected people.
Presidents, potentates, power-brokers of French-speaking countries and even pop starsâ children and fashion designers have been admitted as patients to the historic establishment, known as âLe Valâ, originally set up to minister to wounded frontline soldiers.
However, the famous military establishment that the French press has called the âworld leadersâ hospital of choiceâ has now been defeated by a defence reorganisation and spending cuts.
On Wednesday, French defence minister Jean-Yves Le Drian announced the closure of Val-de-Grâce. Its services are to be transferred to two other lesser-known military hospitals in Paris, though part of it may remain open for medical training and research.
Former centre-right prime minister François Fillon, who was treated at Val-de-Grâce for a kidney stone, was reported to be surprised by the decision to close the hospital and accused the government of making decisions as they went along.
A spokesperson for Fillon said: âFrançois Fillon is very surprised. He has followed the military programme law and it [the closure] wasnât mentioned or in the budget, so heâs surprised that spending cuts are being carried out in such an ill-prepared way ... and improvised.â
Florence Berthout, mayor of the 5th arrondissement of Paris, where the hospital is situated, said the decision was âmad and unjustifiedâ, and has launched a petition to keep it open. The petition calls on the French president, François Hollande, to intervene, describing Val-de-Grâce as a hospital of âinternational renownâ.
âSince the Revolution Val-de-Grâce has been the spearhead of military medicine, and today also civil medicine. The budget argument is not enough!,â it reads.
The two main unions at the hospital, the CGT and Force Ouvrière, have united and called for non-military staff â believed to number around 400 â to demonstrate against the closure.
Berthoud said a number of high-level retired military personnel were planning a campaign to oppose the closure.
Few journalists have had access to the VIP areas of Val-de-Grâce hospital, adding to its mystique. Fantastic rumours have spread of its supposedly luxurious presidential suites, good food and secret entrances.
All have been denied, apart from the above-average hospital meals. However, when LâExpress magazine contacted the hospital a few years ago to ask about the âpresidential suiteâ â various reports had suggested the four-room complex was on the ground floor overlooking the hospital park, museum and 17th-century church â a military spokesperson replied: âNo idea where it is, what it looks like or even if it existsâ.
âSecrecy,â concluded LâExpress, âis something of a speciality at Val-de-Grâce.â
The former French president, François Mitterrand, was admitted under the pseudonym Albert Blot â the name of his doctorâs brother-in-law â and treated for the prostate cancer that would eventually kill him, but that was kept a secret from the French public until shortly before he died.
His secret daughter Mazarine, the result of his long-term double life, was admitted after falling from her horse as a teenager. Medics were said to be initially unsure if they were treating the presidentâs âpetite filleâ (little girl) or âpetite-filleâ (granddaughter).
Mitterrandâs successor, Jacques Chirac, was treated at Val-de-Grâce after a suspected stroke, and his successor The Algerian president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, has been flown to Paris for treatment by Val-de-Grâce doctors on several occasions, as were the late King of Morocco, Hassan II, the last emperor of Vietnam, Bao Dai, members of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assadâs family, the leaders of Guinea-Bissau and Senegal, General de Gaulleâs widow Yvonne, Yves Saint Laurent (hospitalised for depression after military service), and rock star Johnny Hallydayâs daughter.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had been booked into a high-security room at the Val-de-Grâce but was taken instead to another military hospital in the south-west of Paris, where he died.
The hospital was built on the site of a former royal abbey in the heart of what is now Parisâ 5th arrondissement, founded by the French Queen Consort Anne of Austria, wife of Louis XIII and mother of Louis XIV, in 1621.
It was the traditional burial place for members of the royal House of Orléans, several members of which are interred in its church.
During the French Revolution, all royal symbolism was removed from the church, whose high dome dominated the Paris skyline, and the Benedictine abbey became a military hospital in 1796.
In the first world war, the writers Louis Aragon and André Breton worked at Val-de-Grâce as trainee doctors at a time when the hospital was developing facial reconstruction surgery. Its collection of before-and-after wax sculptures of disfigured human faces and the results of surgery, influenced the pairâs later work.
In 1979, the hospital was moved into a new building constructed on what had been the Benedictine nunâs vegetable garden and a military museum and library as well as a medical school were established in the abbey.
Of the 1,000 staff at the 350-bed five-storey hospital, more than half are military personnel, including all the doctors and surgeons and most nurses and health workers. As the hospital is under the control of the defence ministry, employees are subject not only to medical confidentiality but diplomatic discretion.
As former French prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin remarked after being admitted for a gall bladder operation: âItâs not a four-star hotel, but itâs more important than that because itâs a centre of medical excellence that also keeps defence secrets.â
The French government had been considering three options for the hospital: complete closure, partial closure or handing it over the hospital to the public health authorities.
However, keeping it open would have required â¬250m (£198m) to bring its facilities up to 21st-century standards.
Luc Scappini, secretary general of the CFDT Defense union, described the hospital as a âtrue showcaseâ for the militaryâs health service. A demonstration against the closure is planned for 23 October.
