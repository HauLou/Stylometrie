A brilliant young student and leftwing activist who was beaten up by skinheads in Paris died on Thursday evening amid calls for radical far-right groups to be banned.
Clément Méric had been left brain dead after being hit several times by an attacker wearing a knuckleduster on Wednesday near the Saint Lazare railway station.
Police said they had arrested seven people in connection with the attack.
The death of the 18-year-old student at the prestigious Institute of Political Studies, known as Sciences-Po, comes after months of bitter debate and homophobic violence in Several politicians have blamed the protests against homosexual marriage for creating an atmosphere of fear and violence in the country. Méric was a member of the Solidaires students' union and a far-left anti-fascist movement.
The French presidentm François Hollande, on an official visit to Tokyo, described the assault as "an odious act", while the Sénate, the upper house of parliament, denounced what it described as an "abominable assassination".
Méric was attacked around 6pm on Wednesday in the busy 9th arrondissement, not far from the famous Galeries Lafayette and Printemps department stores. He and three friends were reportedly at a private sale of Fred Perry clothing, where witnesses said an altercation erupted between them and three youths with shaved heads wearing bomber jackets.
On Thursday, as police interviewed those present, it was not clear how the fight started, but reports claimed the assailants left the building and waited outside on the street for Méric and his friends.
The student was then allegedly struck several times in the face by an assailant wearing a knuckleduster and hit his head as he fell. Passersby rushed to give him first aid, but he remained unconscious.
The French interior minister, Manuel Valls, promised his "total determination to eradicate this violence that bears the hallmarks of the extreme right. Our values and the republican pact are threatened. There is no place for far right factions who see the nation as the enemy, there is no place for political violence."
Traditional tensions between the far right and far left have been exacerbated in France by the so-called "marriage for all" bill allowing same-sex couples to marry and adopt. The law was passed last month and saw hundreds of thousands of conservative and Catholic protesters take to the streets to oppose the change. There were reports of homophobic attacks across the country.
The anti-gay marriage campaigner who calls herself Frigide Barjot admitted at the time some protests had been hijacked by extreme rightwing troublemakers.
However, on Thursday she reacted angrily to accusations by the businessman philanthropist Pierre Bergé, former partner of the late fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent, that her movement had "paved the way" for violence. On its Twitter account, the anti-gay marriage group Manif Pour Tous (Protest for all), led by Barjot, said it "renewed with force its condemnation of all forms of violence".
Xavier Bongibault, a spokesman for the organisation, said he would "not accept anyone accusing us of being responsible". Barjot has threatened to sue Bergé for defamation.
Leftwing activists have accused members of the far-right Jeunesses Nationalistes Révolutionnaires (Young Revolutionary Nationalists â JNR) of being involved in the attack and called for the group to be banned. The JNR denied the claim.
Marine le Pen, leader of the far-right Front National, told French radio: "It's terrible, the death of a young man is terrible. Unacceptable."
Asked about reports that one of the attackers was wearing a Front National T-shirt, Le Pen warned against jumping to conclusions. "I will wait to see what justice says. You have no proof of anything," Le Pen told RTL radio. "The FN has no connection near or far with this aggression."
Méric, who came from Brest, in Britanny, was accepted at the Sciences Po, after passing his baccalaureate with top honours last year.
Police said they were hunting for three men allegedly involved in the attack on the student, and a woman who was with them.
There were calls for student demonstrations in Paris and other major cities, including Bordeaux, Lyon, Lille and Montpellier on Thursday afternoon.
