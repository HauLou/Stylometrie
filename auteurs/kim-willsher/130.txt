Franceâs finance ministry has ordered an inquiry into why female shoppers are paying more than male consumers for apparently identical products.
Shampoos, deodorants, razors and other goods marketed as âfeminineâ are subject to what a French womenâs rights group says is an âinvisible taxâ making them pricier.
After launching a petition that has attracted 30,000 signatures, government officials have promised to investigate the discrepancies.
The campaign has the support of Pascale Boistard, the secretary of state for womenâs rights, who tweeted: âIs pink a luxury colour?â
One photograph used in the campaign and taken in Monoprix supermarket shows a pink packet of five disposable razors priced â¬1.80 (£1.41), while a blue packet of 10 disposable razors aimed at men costs â¬1.72.
At another store belonging to the chain Casino, campaigners found a 200ml tube of shaving gel cost â¬2.87 for women and â¬2.39 for men.
The Georgette Sand collective has called on Monoprix â whose name means single price â and other shops to stop sexist pricing policies, accusing it of imposing a âwoman taxâ.
âAt Monoprix thereâs no single price! In fact, for similar products, women are paying more than men,â the campaigners wrote. âThe company takes advantage of the fact that womenâs and menâs hygiene products are in different sections in order to apply different prices on products that are mostly similar, if not identical.â
The group found other products, including backpacks, pens and even food, where pricing appeared discriminatory, along with services, including gym membership, dry cleaning and hairdressing charges. It has collected examples on a Tumblr page, saying: âAnd letâs not forget that women earn around 27% less than men and have pensions that are 42% lower than menâs.â
Monoprix denied any policy of price discrimination, saying the cost differences were linked to elements âintrinsicâ to the items and production costs. It argued that because more menâs razors were bought than those for women they could be sold at a lower price.
Franceâs economy ministry announced it would carry out an evaluation of price differences raised by the anti-discrimination campaigners.
âWe know that there have been investigations in the United States and we knew that we would find differences, but not as many as we did and not as easily,â Géraldine Franck of the Georgette Sand collective told Le Parisien.
