The former French president Nicolas Sarkozy would prefer to be left alone to take his daughter to school and travel the world giving speeches.
If his country needs him, however, he will put duty before desire and return to save The ex-president, nicknamed "Super Sarko" during his five-year term at the Elysée, vowed to disappear from public life after his election defeat to the Socialist François Hollande last year.
In Thursday's edition of the centre-right magazine Valeurs Actuelles, however, Sarkozy is reportedly ready to make the ultimate self-sacrifice, saying he might have to make a political comeback "for the sake of France.
"Sadly, there may come a moment when the question is no longer, do you want to?, but, do you have the choice? In this case I cannot say I'm happy taking my daughter to school and doing conferences around the world.
"In that case, obviously, I shall be obliged to do this. Not because of desire, but of duty, and only because it is for France."
However, the magazine quotes the former president as saying that the political world "bores him to death".
"Politics â¦ it's finished. Let's be clear, I've no desire to have anything to do with the political world â¦ and anyway, look how I was treated ... let alone how my wife was treated. Banned from singing for five years," Sarkozy allegedly told friends.
He added that he would be persuaded to return only if France was veering towards the "extremism of the right or that of the left".
He said he had no desire to avenge his defeat by Hollande. "That's a bad thing to feel. And anyway, what kind of revenge would it be to retake France in the state the Socialists will leave her. So, honestly, do I want to come back. No."
Sarkozy was not speaking directly to Valeurs Actuelles, which reported that his comments had been made to close associates who spoke to the magazine, presumably with the former president's blessing.
