For one fleeting instant, an expression of intense exasperation flickered across the face of the immaculately groomed sales assistant in a chic Parisian department store as the Chinese tourists jostled and gestured at watches costing several thousand euros apiece.
Then she bit her lip and smiled. The Chinese visitors counting out wads of euros and engaged in what the The excited chatter was not so much about which monogrammed watch or leather handbag to buy, but how many.
As "Let's be perfectly clear, this is a competition with London, this is a battle between cities. Our goal is that Chinese visitors come to Paris, stay for longer and spend more money," François Navarro, spokesperson for the Ile-de-France regional tourist authority, told the "Of course, we prefer that Chinese tourists come to spend their money in Galeries Lafayette and not in Harrods."
It helps that "Our figures show a rise of about 20% in the number of visas given since then, but it's still not enough. We have fewer visa problems than London because of Schengen but we have asked the French government to make it even easier for the Chinese to obtain visas," Navarro added. "And our goal is to give them the best welcome possible."
To this end, The Paris area draws 33 million tourists a year, creating around 600,000 direct and indirect jobs. It also claims to attract more international visitors â around 17 million â than any other city in the world, including one million Chinese tourists annually, compared with an estimated 110,000 Chinese visitors to London.
Britain's tourist and retail authorities have long warned that the government's tough visa restrictions, aimed at keeping out illegal immigrants, mean the UK is losing out on a growing appetite for international travel among increasingly affluent Chinese, to the tune of £1.2bn a year. The World Tourism Organisation says the number of Chinese tourists travelling abroad increased from 10 million in 2000 to 83 million in 2012. About half of them spend more than £3,000 a trip and account for 25% of sales of luxury goods around the world, giving them considerable economic clout.
In 2012, Shanghai-based Hurun Report reported that France had become the preferred destination for increasing numbers of China's estimated 2.8 million dollar millionaires.
The It says the Chinese, whom Navarro describes as "the kings of shopping", want "luxury shopping above all" and "have an idealised and romantic vision of Paris". It advises: "A simple smile and good day in their own language will keep them more than satisfied."
France's attempts to present a welcoming face to the new tourists from The incident was condemned in China and by France's interior minister, Manuel Valls, aware of potential economic repercussions, as a "xenophobic attack".
In May, the Colbert committee, made up of 75 of France's most prestigious luxury goods companies, including Louis Vuitton, Saint Laurent, Chanel, Dior and Hermès, warned that foreign tourists, particularly Chinese visitors carrying lots of cash, were being deterred from visiting Paris because the city had become "synonymous with insecurity".
However, Edouard Lefebvre of the Champs-Elysées committee, which represents 182 outlets on the celebrated boulevard, said shops were making special efforts to cater for Chinese shoppers, including having "someone who speaks Mandarin, Cantonese and other Chinese languages".
"We've developed a service adapted to their needs, which includes delivering the items they buy to their hotels," Lefebvre said.
And such is their spending power that sales staff, taxi drivers and even the stereotypical epitome of Gallic grumpiness, the Parisian waiter, are being encouraged to proffer a "huang ying guang" (welcome) or "ni hao" (good day), in an effort to encourage the Chinese to part with their money. London and Britain take note.
