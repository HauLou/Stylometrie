"We writers, painters, sculptors, architects, passionate fans of the beauty, until now intact, of It was February 1887 and the foundations of engineer Gustave Eiffel's 312-metre, 10,100-tonne iron tower, which would rise from the banks of the Seine, had only just been excavated.
Now, as the "monstrous" tower marks its 125th birthday, the controversy over why it was built and where, and the clamour from Maupassant and his friends to have it pulled down, has long ceased to matter. On Monday a new phase in the evolution of the Eiffel Tower will be officially inaugurated by the French capital's Socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo; the completion of a two-year, â¬30m (£23.5m) renovation of the 5,000 square metres first floor.
It is a timely riposte to abuse from across the Channel, after John Lewis's managing director, Andy Street, claimed France was "finished" and described Paris's international Gare du Nord station as the "squalor pit of Europe".
The renovation is part of the Paris city authorities' attempts to promote the tower as more than a top tourist attraction but a living, working symbol of the French capital's dynamism and capacity for regeneration.
"Originally it was a challenge of engineering innovation; today the challenge is to continue that spirit, by modernising, renovating, reinterpreting the Eiffel Tower while remaining true to its history," said Jean-François Martins, deputy mayor of Paris. "It's a process of permanent reflection."
The work, which has involved much glass and many burgundy-coloured metal installations, has modernised the pavilions on the first floor, introduced access to the outer platform with its spectacular panoramic views of the city to those in wheelchairs, and added braille to signs and displays. A cinema room shows historic and recent film of the tower.
The project also aims to reduce the tower's carbon footprint by shifting the position of glass panels to reduce air-conditioning bills in summer, introducing solar panels to heat half of the hot water it uses, installing a rainwater collection system to supply the lavatories, and using LED lighting.
The renovated floor, however, has a new attraction that is not for the faint-hearted or those with vertigo. Visitors can now stand on a glass floor and see straight down to the ground from a height of 57 metres. "Oh, that's a bit unnerving!" said Michaela Krause, visiting from Frankfurt in Germany, as she tiptoed around the glass. "No, I won't walk on it, it makes me nervous."
The tower's first floor has undergone two major previous renovations since its completion on 31 March 1889. The first, in 1937, replaced the original ornamental pavilions, and a second in 1981 covered the pavilions in mirrors.
One of the most dramatic and popular changes to the tower was the permanent installation, in 2003, of lights that sparkle for the first five minutes every hour after nightfall until after midnight.
The first floor remained open to visitors throughout the recent work, financed by SETE, the private company that owns 40% of the rights to the tower; the other 60% is owned by the city.
Maupassant never ceased railing about the Eiffel Tower, wailing that it was "this high and skinny pyramid of iron ladders, this giant ungainly skeleton".
His 1890 novel Shortly after, it seemed that Maupassant would be proved right. From 1.9 million visitors in 1889, numbers dropped to a historic low â outside the war years when it was closed â in 1902, with just 121,144. The tower, which was built to last 20 years, only just escaped being dismantled. In 2013, by contrast, it was visited by 6.74 million people.
Martins said: "It's hard to believe today that after the Universal Exhibition in 1900 there was a vote among the Paris council whether to keep the Eiffel Tower or dismantle it. The decision to keep it was won by just two votes. It was that close."
And in a shot to those, such as Andy Street, who seek to denigrate Paris, Martins said: "The tower is the symbol of the French capital, and symbolises Paris's appeal, particularly to tourists. A showcase for French technical knowhow, it alone embodies Paris, a city with great ambitions, rooted in its past, but always forward-looking and open-minded."
