A group of terrified shoppers who took refuge in a supermarket cold store during a terrorist attack in The six people, who escaped to safety only after French special forces launched an assault on the Hyper Cacher store killing gunman Amédy Coulibaly, have accused BFMTV of putting their lives in danger.In a live broadcast during the siege, a journalist from the 24-hour news channel announced that a woman had taken refuge in the refrigerated storeroom.In fact, there were six people, including a three-year-old child and a one-month-old baby, hiding in the room.During the siege Coulibaly, who was heavily armed and who had already gunned down four people in the store, watched coverage of the raid on different television channels and had been in contact with BFMTV journalists.The Paris prosecutorâs office has opened a preliminary inquiry into the legal action. The charge of endangering the lives of others by a âlack of obligatory care for their securityâ carries a maximum penalty of a year in prison and a â¬15,000 (£11,000) fine.The attack on Hyper Cacher was the climax of three days of terrorist attacks in Paris that started with gunmen Chérif and Saïd Kouachi killing 12 people in an assault on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo.The following day, their accomplice Coulibaly shot a female police officer before attacking Hyper Cacher, a kosher supermarket in a south-eastern district of Paris, 24 hours later.As Coulibaly stormed the building on 9 January, a group of shoppers helped by a member of staff fled into the cold store.
During its rolling news programme BFMTV broadcast a report from one of its journalists, who was among the first on the scene and stated: âThere is one person, a woman, who has hidden since the beginning, since the arrival of this man, inside the supermarket, who is hiding in a coldroom, who has taken refuge in the coldroom and is still there, who is supposed to be inside the coldroom, which is at the back of the buildingâ.Later, it was revealed that seven people were hiding in the basement of the supermarket.âOur main worry was that we should not be noticed and we made no noise. If Coulibaly had discovered our presence, there could have been reprisals,â said one of the hostages in their legal complaint, according to Le Parisien newspaper.Hervé Béroud, the editorial director at BFMTV, has admitted that broadcasting the information was a mistake.In March, he told a French television programme: âRegarding Hyper Cacher, we admitted very quickly that the remark made by one of our journalists about the possible presence of a hostage in the coldroom was inappropriate, that it was an error. Yes, thatâs clear.âBFMTV has said, however, that its journalist only made the declaration after obtaining guarantees from sources that broadcasting the information would not endanger the hostagesâ lives.
Patrick Klugman, the lawyer representing the six people involved, told Le Parisien: âThe divulging of the presence of hidden people in the middle of a hostage situation is a mistake that cannot go unpunished, especially as we knew very well that the terrorist was watching the television. Information, even if it is correct, should not endanger lives.âA month after the January attacks, the French audiovisual authority reprimanded 16 media organisations, including BFMTV. It declared that to âbroadcast such information at a time when the terrorists were still a threat risked seriously endangering the safety of the people held in the placeâ.
