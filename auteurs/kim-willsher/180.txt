A Front National mayor has sparked a cultural row after ordering the "ugly" fountain in his town to be painted two shades of blue to "brighten the place up".
Fabien Engelmann, 35, a political adviser to the far-right party's president, Marine Le Pen, has now offered to sell the sculpture back to the artist who created it.
His actions earned a swift rebuke from the country's socialist culture minister, Aurélie Filippetti, who said she was astonished that anyone would decide to repaint a work of art "to make it more decorative â¦ without the artist's permission".
"This incident reveals how elected Front National representatives approach cultural matters," Filippetti said in a statement.
In May, Engelmann â the elected mayor of Hayange in the Moselle in eastern "I received an anonymous call a few days ago to tell me the fountain had been repainted. At first I didn't believe it, but a friend later confirmed it was true," Mila told French journalists. He added that the blue used was "very close to that in the Front National logo" and announced he had begun legal action.
"They should at least remove the paint. It's an attack on my work and my values," he added.
Engelmann said he could not understand the fuss over something, he said, that "could hardly be called art".
"Everyone thinks the fountain is ugly. I didn't mean any harm. Our town is quite gloomy â¦ I just wanted to brighten the place up. We painted the bottom in swimming pool blue and the rest in turquoise. It certainly wasn't intended to damage the fountain."
He offered to sell the fountain back to Mila, adding: "We'll give him a good price."
