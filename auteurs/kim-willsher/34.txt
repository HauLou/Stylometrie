Have you heard the one about the French government minister who suggested interrupting an interview with a journalist to offer to take her to a hotel? Or the politician who turned his back on male reporters to speak to one of their female colleagues because âsheâs wearing a pretty dressâ and âher chest is more interestingâ?
Female French journalists have. Many times over. Now a group of 40 of them has written an open letter to Libération to complain about being subjected to crass and outrageous sexism from French politicians and officials.
The letter also expresses disappointment that little appears to have changed since the fierce debate on political sexism that followed the 2011 arrest of presidential candidate Dominique Strauss-Kahn on charges â later dropped â of sexually assaulting a hotel maid.
âWe thought that the DSK affair had moved things on and the macho habits, symbols of political and personal mediocrity, were becoming extinct. Alas, no,â they write.Listing examples of what they describe as âlewd paternalismâ, including how one official spokesman took a photograph of them sleeping on a flight during the 2012 presidential campaign and shared it with colleagues, the 40 women say they are also fed up with being told: âitâs just a jokeâ and to âget a sense of humourâ.The letter also tells of the ministerial adviser who asked a female journalist after the summer holidays, âAre you tanned all over?â and the MP who, upon walking into a room of female political correspondents, announced âAh, youâre hustling; are you expecting a customer?â
âThe fact that these practices, which reflect what happens on the streets, in factories and in offices every day, involved elected representatives of the republic in charge of making policy, forces us to condemn them,â they write.âThey emanate from across the political spectrum, without exception, and at all levels of power. But as for everyone else, there should be no impunity.â
With a sting in the tail, the letter concludes: âAs long as politics is overwhelmingly in the hands of heterosexual men in their sixties, nothing will change. In 2015, what we would really have liked is to not have to write this.â
Lénaïg Bredoux, a journalist with the investigative website Mediapart, who signed the Libération letter, told the Guardian: âAll of us suffer this kind of thing on a daily basis, but when we got together and talked about our experiences we were actually shocked at the scale of the problem.What has changed is that we feel about to speak out and denounce these things; what has not changed is the attitude of French politicians.
âAfter DSKâs arrest there were a lot of sexist remarks made in his defence and people conflating âseductionâ with âsexual harassmentâ, but insisting his was an isolated case, which it clearly isnât. 
Younger politicians are better, but unless the codes and the male in-jokes change, the attitudes and comments will persist.âBredoux added: âThe fact that this tribune is published shows we feel more able to complain about the crass sexism, but also that we are still a long way from real equality. Itâs a constant fight.â
