Left, right or centre, France's politicians are a ruling elite that resembles an ancien regime desperately clinging to its privilege and power, according to a new book by a Paris-based British author.
If you thought David Cameron and his Eton and Oxbridge clique were posh toffs out of touch with the real world, take a look over the Channel at the "tiny number of brilliant and charming men and women" who constitute the Gallic ruling class, says university lecturer Peter Gumbel.
In his new book, France's Got Talent: the Woeful Consequences of French Elitism, published on Wednesday, Gumbel takes a hard swipe at France's new nobility: the fewer than 500 graduates of elite schools that dominate the highest echelons of business and politics.
Often arrogant, untouchable, unaccountable â and almost certainly unsackable â Gumbel says Just three years after he rattled the French establishment with a scathing indictment of the country's highly selective education system, Gumbel has turned his attention to the Gallic corridors of power and business.
"Since the Revolution, France has had this mythology that it is a meritocracy, that anyone can rise to the highest positions in society by virtue of their intellectual brilliance," Gumbel told the Guardian.
"The idea is the brightest kids in the class can go on to run the country, but it doesn't work. Those in this elite come from much the same upper middle-class background and they are not running the country well.
"They may be smart and swots and get grammar and maths but they don't have experience or, necessarily, ability."
Gumbel added: "David Cameron gets a hard time for surrounding himself with old Etonian buddies and being out of touch, but compared with François Hollande, who has surrounded himself with his old classmates, Cameron seems harmless. In France it's still a system of jobs-for-the-boys that was prevalent in Britain back in the 1950s."
Gumbel says the book is aimed at the disillusioned French public, which is fed up with Hollande and turning to the extreme right and left in increasing numbers, but which "may not be aware of the extent to which the elitist culture it endures is anything but normal by international standards".
He said: "It's not so much a glass ceiling as a concrete one. And with a tiny number of people coming up to run everything, everyone else feels frustrated and left behind."
Gumbel's previous book, They Shoot School Kids, Don't They?, detailed how only about 5% of France's top students get into The book was widely reviewed in France and prompted an invitation to the Élysée Palace to talk about education reforms.
"Ever since I arrived in Paris in 2002 â¦ I have been surprised by the pervasive culture of elitism in France. If this country were a TV show, it would be France's Got Talent, a fiercely competitive contest to show off how clever you are," Gumbel writes.
However, Gumbel says the entire contest is flawed. "Those chosen aren't always the best suited for the roles they are given, while the losers are marked for life."
Britain, the US, Germany and many other countries have broadened their leadership to better reflect their diverse societies, he says. "France is bucking this trend. Here, the demands, if anything, are becoming more elitist."
France has barely opened up, he says, since a 1900 parliamentary report by Alexandre Ribot noted: "A system that classifies men at the age of 20 based on the diplomas they have received deprives the state of the right to choose those who are outstanding, self-made professionals". The report said the system gave those who succeeded "the illusion they simply have to stand in line in order to receive a government post".
And once in the top job, there is little incentive to change anything: mandarins, says Gumbel, "can't be fired â¦ at worst they're 'put in a cupboard', meaning shunted off to a low-profile job or a comfortable sinecure".
As a civil servant told him: "It's like an elevator. You step in and move up."
Gumbel, who lectures at one of France's most elite educational establishments, the Institute d'Études Politiques, better known as Sciences Po and which has educated five of the Fifth Republic's seven presidents, adds: "France needs elites, but it needs better ones. It needs people who are good at drafting reports, but even better at implementing their recommendations.
"To paraphrase General de Gaulle, how is it possible that in a nation that has 365 varieties of cheese, there are so few paths to the top?"

École Nationale d'Administration (ENA) and the École Polytechnique, the most elite of France's top schools, admit just 480 students a year â 0.057% of their age group and "a proportion so minuscule it could be a statistical error".
