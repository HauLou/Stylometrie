It has inspired novels and songs, featured in Harry Potter movies and puzzled historians for the best part of 500 years. The Lady and the Unicorn, regarded as the Mona Lisa of woven artworks, is one of the greatest surviving artefacts of its kind from the Middle Ages.
Now the tapestry, which is in fact a series of six wool and silk tapestries woven in Flanders in the 16th century, can be seen in an entirely new light after a major clean and restoration.
Nearly two years ago, the hangings â five believed to depict the five senses and a sixth bearing the motto "Time and decades of dust had taken their toll on the colours, and the lining from which the tapestry was hung was deforming its shape and designs.
Over the following few months, a team of five restorers removed and replaced the linings and cleared the dust using a form of micro vacuum cleaner. Finally, all six of the panels were rehung in a newly designed room at the museum.
"The tapestry has really come to life again," Audrey Defretin, a spokeswoman for the museum, told the Each of the six separate hangings features a slim, blonde woman with a unicorn to her left and a lion to her right. Their exact provenance remains a mystery, though they are believed to have been commissioned by a member of the prosperous and noble Le Viste family in the late 1400s and created from designs, or "cartoons", drawn in Paris.
The red background of each tapestry is strewn with a rich variety of flowering plants and features pine, orange sessile oak and holly trees, the repeated motif of a coat of arms of three white crescents on a blue background, and animals including numerous rabbits, monkeys and birds.
The first historical mention of the tapestry occurs in 1814 in a description of the château de Boussac, in the Creuse department in central He wrote to the French politician Ludovic Vitet: "All six feature a very beautiful woman ... always placed between a lion and a unicorn. There used to be several others at Boussac, finer ones, the mayor tells me, but the former owner of the château ... cut them up to cover carts and make rugs out of them."
Of the remaining Lady and the Unicorn panels, he concluded: "They will all share the same fate if we do not remove them from Boussac."
By then, the tapestry was badly damaged by neglect, damp and nibbling rats, and the bottom part of one panel had even been cut off by one minor local official to make a "foot rug".
In 1882, Author George Sand contributed to the fame, and consequent rescue, of the artworks with her 1844 novel Turn-of-the-century poet Rainer Maria Rilke â whose words Lady Gaga had tattooed on her arm last year â celebrated the tapestry in his novel More recently, Tracy Chevalier novel Some historians argue that in five of the six panels, the mysterious lady with the unicorn is Mary Tudor, third wife of Louis XII and sister of Henry VIII, who was Queen of France from August 1514 to 1 January 1515.
Elisabeth Taburet-Delahaye, head of the Musée National du Moyen Age and the curator in charge of tapestries, said she knew every detail of the Lady and the Unicorn.
"The poetic and positive atmosphere and the sense of mystery makes her a kind of Mona Lisa," Taburet-Delahaye told "Its status as a masterpiece is a result of the subtle chemistry between its intrinsic qualities and its complex history."
