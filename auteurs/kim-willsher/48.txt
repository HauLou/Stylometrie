As a ferocious battle rages between the Front National president Marine Le Pen and her father, party founder Jean-Marie, the youngest recruit to the political clan might have hoped to escape any negative attention. Instead Marion Maréchal-Le Pen, who became the French republicâs youngest member of parliament four years ago, has found herself not only caught in the middle of the row between her aunt and her grandfather, but attracting plenty of flak herself.
The public television channel France 2 has accused Maréchal-Le Pen, 25, of having a parliamentary assistant illegitimately paid for by the European Union. In its investigative programme While the Paris prosecutorâs office announced it had opened a legal inquiry into âabuse of trustâ following the broadcast, Maréchal-Le Pen reacted angrily, claiming she was the victim of a smear campaign. A statement issued by the MP read: âVery serious allegations have been made attacking her honour and her probity. These accusations seek to make her an accomplice to a misuse of public funds through her parliamentary assistantâs contract. Marion Maréchal-Le Pen is today obliged to justify herself for an imaginary crime.â
It added that she had consulted a lawyer to âre-establish the truth and highlight the lack of ethicsâ shown by the TV team, which she added was an attempt to âdirty and denigrate the work of elected Front National representativesâ.

Maréchal-Le Pen, who is particularly close to her grandfather â she has said he inspired her to enter politics â is also under intense pressure to take sides in the dispute between him and her aunt. While she criticised him for repeating on 2 April his view that the Nazi gas chambers were âa minor detailâ in the history of the second world war, she has since remained publicly silent. Her position is particularly delicate because her name has been mentioned to replace Le Pen senior as head of the FN list for south-eastern Franceâs Provence-Alpes-Côte-dâAzur region in December local elections.
When Jean-Marie made further provocative remarks in an extreme-right magazine, Marine has seen her partyâs popularity rise since she took control in 2010 and launched an operation to rid the FN of its more extreme elements. To compound an already bad week for the party, it was also announced that judges were looking into the financing of her 2012 presidential bid and the FNâs general election campaign shortly afterwards, following a decision to put the boss of a private company allegedly linked to the far right under official investigation for âillegally financing a political partyâ. French law forbids private business from funding political movements.
Away from the legal sideshow, it is the row between Marine and Jean-Marie that remains the main attraction. As one French commentator pointed out: âItâs rare that we witness a patricide first hand.â
Jean-Marieâs decision to express himself in Marine Le Pen is a demon, an absolute enemy from all points of view â¦ Itâs total revulsion, which is in fact reciprocal.â
Marine has called on her father to fall on his sword and step out of the political ring. In his controversial interview Jean-Marie made it clear he would go down fighting. âYou only leave the ring, even when bloody, at the end; whether you are victorious or vanquished,â he said.
