Political allies and opponents lined up on Thursday to denounce what was described as an "outrageous" and "indecent" attack on François Hollande by his former partner.
In a rare show of unity that has so far eluded the French president during more than two years in power, there was widespread shock and anger at the deeply intimate kiss and tell written by former first lady Valérie Trierweiler.
The journalist, pushed out of the Elysée Palace after Hollande's affair with actor Julie Gayet was revealed in January, vented her scorn and fury in the 320-page memoir: Merci Pour ce Moment (Thank You for the Moment). While detailing her own misery and heartbreak she portrayed the president as cold, calculating and â perhaps most damagingly for a Socialist politician â dismissive of the country's poor, whom she claimed he disliked and branded Le Parisien newspaper had just one word for the blatant score settling. "Pathetic," read its headline.
The French prime minister, Manuel Valls, said: "When you lower the public debate with outrageous attacks or mix public and private lives, you debase the debate." He called for respect for everyone and dignity.
The president of the far-right Front National, Marine Le Pen, was scathing, describing the book as a dishonour for Thierry Mariani, MP for French living abroad, said he found Trierweiler's behaviour "indecent".
The book, given an unprecedented 200,000 print run, is expected to earn Trierweiler, 49, at least â¬500,000 (£396,000). It was written and published in the utmost secrecy, and printed abroad. On Thursday, the memoir was the bestselling book on Amazon France.
The Elysée Palace said it was not aware of the memoir before it appeared in bookshops on Thursday morning. It did not comment on the contents.
If she was looking to tug at heartstrings after being unceremoniously dumped by Hollande, 60, Trierweiler received little sympathy. Commentators and critics declared the book an assault not just on the man but also the role and position of president, and said that by dragging the public into the Elysée bedroom, the Paris Match journalist had crossed a "red line".
Nadia Le Brun, who wrote a biography of Trierweiler, told French journalists: "Valérie Trierweiler was cheated on, repudiated, abandoned. Today she is acting like a female killer who has only one wish: revenge."
Le Brun's co-author, Airy Routier, added: "By making the intimate details of their relationship public, she has discredited her ex, discredited herself and gains nothing."
The book comes less than a fortnight before Hollande's government faces a vote of confidence in the French National Assembly. On top of private woes, the president is struggling to appear politically credible in his so far unsuccessful effort to tackle high unemployment, public debt and stagnant economic growth.
Revealing herself as insecure, emotionally frail and often solipsistic, Trierweiler details two occasions when she took heavy doses of sleeping pills, which left her semi-conscious. Among several claims in the book, Trierweiler suggests she was kept drugged with "astronomical doses of tranquillisers" in hospital so she would not create a scandal after Hollande's affair with Gayet became public.
On the night of Hollande's presidential triumph in May 2012, Trierweiler was distraught when Hollande rebuffed one of her suggestions. "At that minute, I foresaw that nothing would be as it was before," she writes. Today, Hollande can say the same.
