Doctors have prevented François Hollande visiting his partner Valérie Trierweiler in hospital, saying she is tired and needs a complete break.
But France's first lady broke her silence to reveal that the president has sent her chocolates and flowers, according to radio reports.
Trierweiler was taken to hospital a week ago after a French magazine published revelations that Hollande, 59, was allegedly having an affair with an actor. On Thursday, RTL radio station claimed to have spoken to Trierweiler, who said she had not seen Hollande since last Friday, but did not feel abandoned by him.
Doctors had said she needed a break and rest and advised that he should stay away.
"François Hollande has not yet visited her in hospital, but Valérie Trierweiler doesn't want people to think he is neglecting her at such a painful time," RTL said. "She has let it be known that it is the doctors who have banned the head of state from coming to see her â¦ a widespread practice in cases of psychological distress."
RTL said Trierweiler was "temporarily confined and being kept at a distance from her entourage to give her space to get back on her feet. Bur François Hollande speaks to the care team and has met them personally."
Trierweiler, 48, was said to be "very tired to the point of not being able to stand up", and suffering from low blood pressure, as well as low morale. "She hopes to leave with her head held high and shows a willingness to fight at least for her dignity."
RTL said Trierweiler had let it be known that she had not had a "nervous breakdown" when Hollande confessed to his alleged affair with Julie Gayet, 41, hours before Closer magazine published its "special edition" claiming Hollande had been secretly leaving the Elysée Palace for secret trysts with the actor. Other newspapers and magazines claimed Trierweiler was determined to "stand by her man" and fight to save her relationship with Hollande.
Le Nouvel Observateur said she "has not the slightest intention of packing her bags".
"She's OK to forgive, but not OK to leave," the magazine said.
Hollande refused to say if there was still a first lady in Julie Gayet, the actor at the centre of the French presidential scandal, began legal action to sue Closer magazine on Thursday for breach of privacy. She is claiming â¬50,000 in damages, â¬4,000 in legal costs and publication of the legal judgement over half of the magazine's front cover.
Closer magazine confirmed that it had received legal papers, but refused to comment further. A spokesperson for the publication said a second "special edition" with new information and photographs would appear on Friday morning.
