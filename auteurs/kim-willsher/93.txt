A coach carrying 32 British passengers skidded off a motorway near Chambéry in south-east Police reported that 13 people had been taken to hospital and the others had been taken to a nearby village hall where they were being examined by doctors.
The passengers had set off from the Alpine ski resort of La Rosière Montvalezan and were returning when the coach crashed on the A43 at 8.45am. The motorway links the ski station with Lyon or joins the road to Grenoble.
The coach overturned near the village of Sainte-Hélène-du-Lac. It was claimed that five passengers, among the 13 reportedly taken to hospital, had been âslightly injuredâ, two of them children.
France 3 television said the coach was on its way to Chambéry airport, where the passengers were due to fly back to the UK, when the accident happened.
