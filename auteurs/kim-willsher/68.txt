A young Albanian migrant threatened with expulsion from Armando Curri, 19, was originally told he was not welcome at the ceremony held in the Sénat â the upper house of parliament â on Wednesday morning, because of his âirregular statusâ.
Curri arrived in France three years ago and was allowed to remain as an unaccompanied minor. However, on reaching the age of 18 last year he was served with an order to leave France.After a last minute about-turn, the head of the Sénat, Gérard Larcher, a member of UMP, the centre-right opposition party, told Curri he could attend.
Local police announced they would give the teenager a three-month temporary residency permit.In a story that confounded stereotypes, Curri told his local radio station France Bleu Loire it was the best day of his life and that he was proud of what he had achieved.âIâve received these wonderful things thanks to you and the newspapers. In one day my life has changed. Iâm very happy,â Curri said.âIâm proud of myself for having got here. You should never give up because youâll get there in the end.âCurri, who has appealed against the expulsion order, was originally informed his gold medal and diploma for being Franceâs best carpentry apprentice would be sent by post to his home at Roanne in the Loire region. A message from the upper house explained that it was unable to âwelcome into its midst an undocumented personâ.A few hours later, Larcher, having been given details of Curriâs work, informed the French interior ministry that he had changed his mind and that the teenager deserved to be congratulated for his success.âAs a matter of principle, the Sénat, as a Republic institution involved in making laws, should respect them. In terms of reality, apprenticeships are an excellent thing that the Sénat wishes to promote,â Larcher said in a statement.Curri, now studying for a professional baccalauréat at his local lycée, must wait until May, when the administrative court in Lyon will consider his appeal against the expulsion order, to find out if he will be allowed to remain permanently in the country.On Wednesday morning, however, Curri, pictured in suit and bow tie at the ceremony in the gilded Sénat salon, was just proud to be one of Franceâs best apprentices.
