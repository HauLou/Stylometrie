Were Major John Howard alive today, he would no doubt stiffen his ageing back, drop his walking stick and stand to attention in front of a glass museum case containing his commanding officer's uniform, to give a brisk salute.
Even in his final frail years, when returning to He would then cross the road that divides the Normandy hamlet of Bénouville to survey the old Pegasus bridge and the stumpy concrete monument marking the spot where his glider landed in the early minutes of 6 June 1944 in what was the first operation of D-Day.
Once this homage had been paid to fallen colleagues from Operation Deadstick, whose success was vital to the entire D-Day plan, Howard would tell stories you would not find in the history books. How when his glider hit the ground in occupied France at 16 minutes past midnight on 6 June, shaking up the men inside, everything went dark.
"I thought I'd bashed my head and gone blind," he would say. "Couldn't see a thing. Then one of my men pointed out that when I'd bashed my head my tin helmet had wedged over my eyes. What a relief!"
Or how, upon overhearing a group of German children at the Pegasus bridge museum casting doubt on whether he could have been wearing the helmet with the bullethole in it and still lived to tell the tale, he took the helmet out of the display case, put it on and used a pen to match the hole to the scar on his scalp.
Howard is no longer around to tell his wonderful tales â he died in 1999, aged 86. The uniform worn by his commanding officer, General Sir Richard Nelson "Windy" Gale, is now displayed in a museum that Prince Charles opened in 2000 and the old Pegasus Bridge, replaced by a new bridge in 1994 and left to rot in a field, has been cleaned up and preserved.
In Bénouville, however, his memory lives on; as well as the plaques and a large brass bust of Howard, the museum has been built on Avenue du Major Howard, where on Friday the few veterans still able to make the pilgrimage, along with the families and relatives of those who cannot, will return to Pegasus Bridge to commemorate the 70th anniversary of D-Day and the Normandy landings.
Like Howard's anecdotes, the story of Pegasus bridge is worth retelling. In the past seven decades it has been dusted with Hollywood magic, embellished by those who were not there, immortalised in history books and carved into local legend. In the years of planning for D-Day, the taking of both Bénouville bridge, later named Pegasus bridge after the 6th Airborne's flying horse badge emblem, which spanned the Caen Canal, and nearby Ranville bridge, over the River Orne, were identified as vital. If they could be held, a German counterattack on the eastern flank of the allied forces landing at Sword beach could be prevented.
Led by Howard, the 181 men of D Company, 2nd Ox and Bucks Light Infantry who took part in Deadstick had trained for months. Their gliders were towed over the Channel and released. Using just a stopwatch and a compass, the pilots had to land precisely and silently to surprise the German occupiers. Astonishingly, nearly all did. Howard's glider came down only 47 yards from the bridge at Bénouville. Leaping from the aircraft, Howard's men neutralised the bridges and held them before reinforcements arrived later that day from the 7th Parachute Battalion. Among the new arrivals was the young actor Richard Todd, who would play the major in the film The coded message "Ham and Jam", indicating that both bridges had been captured, was transmitted. The battle was brief â over in 10 minutes â with the loss of only two British soldiers.
It would determine the events of D-Day and prove decisive in the liberation of France. It also defined lives. Nothing that Howard, the former policeman turned war hero awarded the Distinguished Service Order and the Croix de Guerre, did after the war would match the terror, excitement and derring-do of the Pegasus operation. But for some local people, the aftermath to the drama and triumph of D-Day was decidedly bittersweet.
For Françoise Gondrée, whose parents Georges and Thérèse ran the cafe near the bridge where she was born in 1944, the legacy has been one of bitter division and disappointment. The Gondrées' cafe became a beacon for British troops and remains popular with tourists, but sparked bickering and personal battles between two of their three daughters.
Françoise no longer speaks to her older sister Arlette who, on their parents' deaths, won the auction for the renamed Pegasus Cafe and has fallen out with the French authorities over who owns the memorabilia and military artefacts in the museum.
Spurred by a sense of injustice and disappointment, she has spent six years writing a hefty tome which she claims is the "true story" and is pursuing so far fruitless legal battles. "When I come here today, what do I feel?..." she says, pursing her lips. "Before it was a place to honour heroes, today it's nothing but a Hollywood fête," she said, standing by the bridge on a chilly May morning.
"Don't forget I grew up with these men, these heroes and their pilgrimage back here. When I was little, my mother would make bouquets of flowers for the families to place on the graves of those who died. My father would invite the men into the cafe for drinks and food. They were part of our family." She adds: "Of course the events at Pegasus bridge marked me."
At the Pegasus bridge museum, curator Mark Worthington has no time for local squabbles. He is busy preparing for this week's commemorations, including a visit by the Prince of Wales. Worthington says the memory of 70 years ago is being kept alive by the families of the British servicemen who took part in the D-Day operation.
"It's poignant to think that this will be the last big year for most of the veterans. We know all these guys because they come every year. The youngest are nearly 90 now. But their children and grandchildren come and lots of ordinary members of the public, British and French."
Worthington says the reason is that the story of Pegasus bridge still captures imaginations. "The planning, the precision of the pilots who with just a stopwatch and a compass landed gliders in the dark within 47 yards of the bridge is astonishing, even today. Even helicopter pilots have told us they'd have difficulty doing it now. It was the most amazing and successful mission of the entire D-Day operation."
