The French comedian Dieudonné M'bala M'bala has been cleared by a Paris court of diffusing material likely to cause racial hatred.
The judge made no ruling on the content of a 2010 video â for which the controversial comic had already been sentenced last year â but said he could not be found responsible for it being distributed on YouTube.
The video included a song called "Shoah-nanas" (Holocaust chicks), anti-Jewish insults and called for a man jailed for the 2006 murder of a young Jewish man to be freed.
The public prosecutor had requested that Dieudonné, 47, be jailed if he did not pay â¬65,000 (£54,000) of outstanding fines for convictions linked to racist and antisemitic comments.
In November 2013 an appeal court upheld an earlier judgment against a Dieudonné video for "defamation of those belonging to a community or religion" and being an "apologist" for a murder.
Several of Dieudonné's shows were banned by the authorities in The British home secretary, Theresa May, barred the comedian from entering the UK after he announced plans to support the footballer Nicolas Anelka at his Football Association disciplinary hearing for performing a "quenelle" during a Premier League match.
Dieudonné, who claims to have invented the quenelle, says it is an anti-establishment gesture. However, he has failed to distance himself from those who have performed the gesture â described as an inverted Nazi salute â in front of Jewish monuments, memorials and buildings.
On Friday, antisemitism campaigners lodged a legal complaint after a photograph reportedly appeared on Dieudonné's website showing two men performing the gesture at the abandoned village of Oradour-sur-Glane, the French site of a Nazi massacre during the second world war. In June 1944, an SS division killed 642 villagers, including 450 women and children who were herded into the local church, which was then locked and set alight.
Dieudonné is facing several police inquiries, notably into accusations he has organised his own bankruptcy to avoid paying fines, and that he attacked a bailiff attempting to deliver a writ to his home, as well as an investigation into alleged racist comments about a French radio presenter, Patrick Cohen.
