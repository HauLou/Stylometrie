The former French justice minister, She said: âI want to see what member states are doing that is working and to understand what tools are lacking today to combat the radicalisation of European individuals, often young, for whom jihad has become a cause if not an identity.â
âI want to understand what leads a young person to become radicalised. I will also analyse how She added: âThe attacks in Paris, Copenhagen, Tunis, show that we face a common challenge that transcends national borders. We have no choice but to tackle it together if we are to better protect all European citizens.
âIn an area of the free movement of people and information, the most appropriate and effective action on security and the fight against terrorism can only come at the European level. Terrorists will always benefit from the lack of coordination between EU countries.

âA clear and binding framework should be put in place for the cooperation of intelligence services within the EU and also third countries that are victims of terrorism and jihad.â
The former centre-right minister will also visit British NGOs fighting radicalisation, particularly that of young women, in London before travelling to Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium and unspecified non-EU countries.
