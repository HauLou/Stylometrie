French actor Julie Gayet is seeking â¬50,000 damages from the glossy celebrity magazine that revealed her affair with president François Hollande, it emerged today as the case started in a Paris court.
Gayet says the report in Closer that showed the president arriving on the back of a scooter for secret trysts with her in a Paris apartment near the Elysée was an invasion of her privacy.
The revelations caused an international scandal and left the president's shocked partner Valérie Trierweiler in hospital for a week.
Hours after she was discharged, Hollande released a terse statement announcing he was "putting an end to their shared life".
It threatened to be an expensive day for Closer. As Gayet's legal action began in a court at Nanterre on the outskirts of Paris, the magazine was ordered to pay â¬12,000 to Trierweiler for publishing photographs of her on holiday in Mauritius after the split.
Closer magazine defended its decision to publish the report and photographs in January, saying the clandestine meetings raised questions about the president's security and that the affair was in the public interest.
Hollande said he was "totally indignant" about the Closer report of his affair but did not deny it. He insisted his private life remain private.
Jean Enocchi, lawyer for Gayet, who did not attend the hearing, told the court on Thursday: "It's a classic case of violation of privacy and that's what we are pleading."
Laurence Pieau, the editor of French Closer, said the magazine had only published information that had been doing the rounds in "dinner parties â¦ and being laughed about in television studios" for several months.
"We did our duty as journalists in giving exact information that the public had a right to know," she added.
Gayet has claimed she is being harassed by paparazzi photographers and has also launched legal actions for invasion of privacy and "endangering the lives of others" that are being investigated by police.
It is not known whether Hollande has continued his relationship with Gayet since the scandal broke.
The court will announce its decision on 27 March.
