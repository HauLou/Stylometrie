She was one of the most celebrated collectors of contemporary masters, whose art was displayed in a magnificent 18th-century palace on Veniceâs Grand Canal. But since the death 36 years ago of heiress Peggy Guggenheim, her family have been engaged in a bitter legal battle over how her priceless legacy â including works by Picasso, Miró, Matisse, Magritte, Cocteau, Salvador Dali and Jackson Pollock â is managed.
On Tuesday, one of Guggenheimâs grandsons will launch a court appeal to have the Italian collection restored to its original state, claiming it has been âdilutedâ by art from other sources.
Sandro Rumney, who was born in Venice but lives in The move is the latest develoment in a long-running transatlantic legal battle between two branches of Guggenheimâs descendants.
Peggy Guggenheim was just 13 when she inherited the considerable fortune of her father Benjamin, a metal magnate, who was travelling on the Titanic. She led a colourful life and married three times. While in As she approached the end of her life in 1979, she handed over the palace and the collection of 326 works to the Solomon Guggenheim Foundation, based in Rumneyâs lawyer, Olivier Morice, said the legal action centred on ârespecting the wishes of Peggy Guggenheim to see the collection intactâ.The plaintiffs complain that works from other collections are now part of the permanent display at the palazzo, diluting Peggyâs work. They hired bailiffs to analyse the displays, finding in 2013 that of the 181 works at the palazzo, 75 are from the Schulhof collection, put together by a couple of American art collectors.
They contend that when she bequeathed the collection to the Guggenheim Foundation, it was intended as a kind of visual autobiography. They notably point to a 1969 exchange of letters with Harry Guggenheim, then president of the foundation, in which he accepted her strict conditions that the collection should be âkept as a whole and at the palazzoâ, without additions.Rumney, 56, is also furious that the inscription on the museumâs Grand Canal facade now includes the words âSchulhof Collectionâ next to âPeggy Guggenheim Collectionâ.âThat was the last straw. The Guggenheim is horrible. This has been going on for 10 years now,â Rumney Rumney said last May.
This âbreaks with the original arrangement that Peggy wanted and which should be respected after her deathâ, the plaintiffs argue.
Rumney and his children suffered a setback in July when a lower court threw out the case. It said the dispute had been settled in the 1990s when it was ruled the collection could not be considered as âprotectedâ. Rumney and Hélion say the 1996 protocol has been breached and accuse the foundation of âcommercial cynicismâ.
Three other grandchildren and one great-grandchild are supporting the Guggenheim Foundation, which was established in 1937 by Peggy Guggenheimâs uncle. One grandchild is employed by the foundation.
The Guggenheim Foundation said it was fighting âbaseless allegationsâ. It added that it was âproud to have faithfully respected the wishes of Peggy Guggenheim for more than 30 years by keeping her collection intactâ, restoring the palace and running the âmost visited modern and contemporary art museum in Italyâ.
