France's former first lady Valérie Trierweiler has spoken of the contrast between her golden â if brief â life at the Elysée Palace and her modest background.
Trierweiler also admitted that news of François Hollande's affair with a French actor left her feeling like she had "fallen from a skyscraper".
French journalists from Paris Match magazine and Le Parisien spoke to Trierweiler, 48, during her two-day visit to India at the weekend for the humanitarian organisation Action Contre La Faim (Action against Hunger). She left After her partner's terse statement, Trierweiler says she returned home and refused to put on the television or radio. Instead she watched a film.
"It may seem strange but for me it wasn't a time of crisis. It's not the first split in my life. It was violent because it was publicised," she told Paris Match. She admitted the couple had become "detached" but said the revelations in Closer magazine that Hollande 59, had been leaving the Elysée for secret trysts with Julie Gayet, 41, had come as a complete shock.
"I heard rumours of course, but you hear rumours about everyone. I heard them about me as well, all the time. I didn't pay them any attention.
"When I knew it was as if I'd fallen from a skyscraper".
After Hollande spoke to her about the affair, the evening before Closer magazine was published, she said there followed a long night "spent talking, without eating or sleeping". The next morning she was so exhausted after a week of travelling "plus the shock" that she fainted. When she came round, she was asked if she wanted to go to hospital and agreed.
During the week she spent "resting" she was visited by the youngest of her three sons, Leonard, 16, who brought her flowers.
Trierweiler told French journalists her privileged life at the Elysée had not entirely suited her. Born in Angers, the fifth of six children, Trierweiler's father was a civilian war invalid after losing a leg stepping on a mine as a 12-year-old boy. Her mother worked in the ticket office of the local ice rink.
"I found myself at the Elysée with all its gilding. People don't really know this, but my mother was a cashier and my father had a leg amputated. I grew up in a council house. There was this enormous gulf ... I realised int he last few months just how lucky I had been," she said.
When doctors allowed Hollande to visit her in hospital she told him she would stand by him. Days later he announced that they should separate, but she refused to sign a joint statement, saying it was his decision and his responsibility.
"It takes two to be in love but only one to leave," she added.
"I am more disappointed than angry," she told Le Parisien, which suggested she may write a book. She added that had Hollande not been elected president in 2012 the couple might still be together. "At a moment, there was no longer any life. We didn't experience power in the same way. Something was broken. I would have preferred a normal life," she said.

Trierweiler has said she will probably return to work as a journalist and will continue her charity work.
It's in my interest to return to a normal life as soon as possible because I don't want to be a celebrity and I won't be one," she said.
