The French president, François Hollande, has threatened legal action over claims he is having an affair with an actor.
The glossy celebrity magazine Closer published a special edition on Friday including a seven-page report on the leader's alleged relationship with Julie Gayet.
In a statement from the Elysée Palace, Hollande did not directly deny the report but accused the magazine of breaching his privacy. He said advisers were looking at what action to take against the magazine, which caused a storm in 2012 after publishing paparazzi photographs of the topless Duchess of Cambridge on a private holiday in the south of The statement said Hollande "deeply deplores the attacks on the principle of respect for privacy, to which he, like every citizen, has a right". However, it did not directly deny the story of the affair.
Closer published photographs showing a man in a motorcycle helmet outside what it said was Gayet's Paris apartment, along with a man reported to be the president's bodyguard.
Subsequent photos taken in the morning show the man said to be the bodyguard arriving with what Closer said was a bag of croissants.
Hollande's partner is the former Paris Match journalist Valérie Trierweiler, who is considered to be France's first lady. He has four children with the politician Ségolène Royal, who ran against Nicolas Sarkozy in the 2007 presidential race.
In March last year, Gayet, 41, began legal action to identify who was behind internet rumours that she was romantically involved with the president.
During Hollande's 2012 election campaign she took part in a political broadcast in which she described the presidential candidate as "humble", "incredible" and a man who "really listens".
In the past, the French media have been considerably more circumspect about the love lives of the country's leaders, who have taken refuge behind the country's strict privacy laws.
For many years, the last Socialist president of France, François Mitterrand, led a double life with his wife, Danielle, and lover, Anne Pingeot, with whom he had a daughter, Mazarine. Although the existence of Mitterrand's second family was an open secret, nothing was ever published until Paris Match obtained photos of Mazarine, then aged 20, and got the president's permission to publish them.
The Closer story provoked a storm on Twitter, coming just hours after the banning of a show by the controversial comedian Dieudonné M'Bala M'Bala, and the announcement that La Redoute, a mail order company, was laying off hundreds of staff.
Journalist Guy Birenbaum wrote in the Huffington Post that the idea of personal privacy in France was being dragged into the 21st century. What would have started as polite whispers during chic dinner parties now "becomes information, some days or some weeks later".
"Nobody powerful,(including the president) has the power these days to stop or block anything, and certainly not this "type" of thing," Birenbaum wrote.
"The era when twenty Parisian journalists "protect" the second family of a president of the republic for years on end has passed. With Twitter, François Mitterrand's secrets would have lasted a month, the "escapades" of Chirac, not more than three weeks ... it's a fact, not a cry of joy."
He concluded: "The happy set up of newspaper stories with pictures of Madame, Monsieur and their children, belong to the past."
Reaction to reports of the alleged affair brought a rare unity to France's political class.
Harlem Désir, head of the ruling Socialist party said: "It's nothing to do with political life, therfore I don't see why it should be a political debate. There should be respect for the private person and for the presidential role. I have no comment to make."
Marine Le Pen, president of the far-right Front National, agreed. "I agree with having respect for privacy, for everyone. As long as it doesn't cost the taxpayer a centime, I consider that everyone has the right to have their private life respected â¦ any attack on this shocks me."
The prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said: "As a citizen, the president of the republic, François Hollande, has requested that his private life be respected. He is right. I have nothing to add to what he has said."
Laurence Piau, editor of Closer, told 


When François Hollande stood for election as president in 2012, he promised to be "Monsieur Normal".
And French history reveals that nothing could be more "normal" than a French president who is, as the Quai d'Orsay diplomats might say euphemistically, a bit of a ladies' man.
Think François Mitterrand, who had a secret double life and "hid" his lover and their daughter for more than two decades with the complicity of a handful of French journalists.
Think Jacques Chirac, whose chauffeur told of driving the president to assignations and described him as "Monsieur 15 minutes, shower included"; Chirac's roving eye drove his formidable wife Bernadette to distraction. "Remember, when Napoleon lost Josephine, he lost everything", she would declare.

Think Nicolas Sarkozy, who, during a brief separation from his second wife Cecilia, who later left him for good, reportedly sent a text message saying he intended to ask the female journalist he had taken on holiday to marry him if his wife did not return forthwith.

Even the seemingly upstanding Valéry Gistard d'Estaing, president from 1974-81, was rumoured to have as many mistresses as Paris has salons. In the infamous "Milk lorry" case of September 1974, d'Estaing was at the wheel of a borrowed Ferrari driving through Paris with a mysterious woman in the passenger seat, when he pranged it in a collision with a milk lorry at 5am. The woman's identity has never been confirmed, but she was rumoured to be a famous French actress.

And spare a thought for Félix Faure, French president from 1895-99, who died in the bed of his mistress, Marguerite Steinheil, but who still had a Paris metro station named after him.

The list of French royal mistresses goes back to King Clovis I in the sixth century, but among the most celebrated and influential were Diane de Poitier, Henri II's courtesan, and Madame de Pompadour, official chief mistress of Louis XV.

In their book Sexus Politicus, journalists Christophe Deloire and Christophe Dubois write that to be successful a French politician must also be seductive. "Far from being a fault, to cast yourself in the role of seducer is without doubt an important quality in our political life," they say.
