As many as 100 Britons are believed to have been jailed in Most of those convicted were motorists who hid migrants in their vehicles in Calais, believing they were unlikely to be caught, it was claimed on Tuesday.Julie Colaert, the deputy public prosecutor for the French port town, told the BBC that smuggling gangs were increasingly recruiting car and van drivers to take migrants to Britain.She said a quarter of those brought to local courts on charges of people smuggling were from the UK, second only to eastern 
Colaert told the BBCâs File on 4 programme: âIn the past two years we have seen more and more English smugglers.âTrafficking gangs are employing them to take people across in their cars. The migrants pay a lot of money because itâs sold as guaranteed passage to the UK.â 
Smugglers can make up to â¬4,000 (£2,840) a trip, she said, but face between six months and two years in prison if convicted.Colaert was unable to give exact figures, because it is illegal in France to compile statistics based on nationality, race or religion. However, she estimated that between five and ten UK smugglers were being prosecuted in France a month and up to 100 people from the UK had been convicted and given jail terms by French courts for people smuggling over the previous year.In a recent case highlighted by the BBC, Basir Haji, from Preston, Lancashire, was sentenced to 12 months in prison after being caught at the Calais ferry terminal with two Iraqi men hidden in the boot of his car. He told the court he had agreed to smuggle them across the Channel for £500.âIâm in debt, thatâs why I did it. Iâve been playing a lot of money in the casino,â Haji told File on 4 before being taken to prison.Haji admitted he was part of a smuggling network and said there were three people above him in the organisation. He claimed the head of the gang was based in England.Colaert said the number of Britons charged with smuggling migrants had leapt in the past two years. Smuggling gangs were shunning lorries, which are closely monitored by police, and choosing cars and vans which they thought were less likely to be stopped and searched, she said.Europol, the EU law enforcement agency, confirmed that organised criminal gangs and opportunistic individuals based in the UK were involved in people smuggling.
French lawyers said local people hit by the continuing economic crisis are also being tempted into the lucrative business, with about 80 individuals having been arrested in the past 12 months.Earlier this year, Emmanuelle Osmont, a lawyer in Boulogne-sur-Mer who has represented several French people accused of helping traffickers, told France 2 television the gangs were targeting students and local traders in âfinancial difficultiesâ.
She said: âUltimately, the mafia networks have infiltrated the local economy.â
Calais, home to the so-called Jungle 2 migrant camp â which replaced a previous camp dismantled by French police in 2009 â has seen a spike in the number of migrants arriving to try to cross to the UK from about 1,000 in April to more than 3,000 in recent weeks.
