France's new prime minister, In his first speech since being appointed last week, Valls laid out his government's priorities and pledged to "open a new chapter" for the beleaguered and unpopular president François Hollande and his Socialist administration.
"Too much suffering, not enough hope. That is France's situation," Valls said in the 47-minute address to the lower house of parliament.
In the vote of confidence, French MPs supported the Socialist government by 306 against 239 with 26 abstentions.
The appointment of Valls, who hails from the right of the Socialist party, was seen as a last-ditch attempt by Hollande to woo disappointed voters after a disastrous showing in local elections 10 days ago.
Valls said he had heard the message from the French people.
Among the measures announced to pull the ailing economy out of the doldrums, Valls said taxes for those on low incomes would be reduced from January 2015 and employment costs for companies would be cut by â¬30bn (£25bn) from 2016. Companies will not have to pay charges for workers on minimum wages, which Valls described as "a true revolution". A number of other taxes will be cut altogether.
Valls also vowed to cut â¬19bn from state spending, â¬10bn from the health budget, and â¬10bn from local government as part of Hollande's "responsibility pact". A further â¬11bn would be cut, he said, without specifying where from.
The government will cut the number of France's administrative regions from 27 to around 14 by 2017, and step up its low-carbon strategy, setting targets of reducing fossil fuel consumption by 30% and greenhouse gases by 40% between now and 2030. France's dependence on nuclear energy is to be cut by 50% by 2025, Valls declared.
Although two members of the green party, EELV, left the government when Valls was appointed, he insisted he would work with them: "I have no enemies on the left," he said.
