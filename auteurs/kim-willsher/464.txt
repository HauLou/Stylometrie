It takes a brave government minister to touch something as sacrosanct as France's two-month summer holidays.
So the education minister, Vincent Peillon, was either being courageous or committing political suicide when he announced on Monday that he wanted the school summer break reduced from eight to six weeks.
Peillon already has a bloody nose from attempts to overhaul the French education system, suggesting pupils should give up their midweek day off or have classes on Saturday mornings in exchange for a daily reduction of the school day by 45 minutes. The idea caused a walkout among staff at schools last month and has brought teachers and parents on to the streets in protest.
After dropping his summer holiday bombshell, Peillon admitted it would not take effect before 2015, when he hopes to have forced through reforms that will mean French pupils attending school 4.5 days a week instead of the current four.
President François Hollande promised to overhaul the education system after he was elected in May last year, saying: "France has the shortest school year and the longest day." He pledged a massive shakeup, including a reduction in the amount of homework and less "redoubling" or repetition of a school year for those deemed unable to keep up.
Since 1882 when free state schools were introduced in Under Hollande's plans, as well as a 4.5-day school week, the teaching day â which often runs from before 9am until after 4pm with a two-hour break for lunch every weekday except Wednesday â is to be shortened by 45 minutes. The changes are expected to come into effect from the school year beginning in September 2013, but some local authorities have already sought permission to postpone the reforms for a year.
Secondary school students in France spend an average of 847 hours a year in school, compared with an average of 774 in many European countries. Recent studies, however, have shown that France is falling behind in education standards compared with its European neighbours and the United States.
In his book about the French education system, They Shoot Schoolchildren, Don't They?, the British journalist Peter Gumbel said the long school day was only part of the problem. He said he believed French schooling was out of date, grinding and dull.
Gumbel, a lecturer at the Institute of Political Science, known as Sciences Po, attacked a classroom culture that, he said, branded students as "worthless" and was counterproductive and contrary to France's republican ideals.
"Why is France the only country in the world that discourages children because of what they cannot do, rather than encouraging them to do what they can?" Gumbel wrote. "I believe France is missing a key element of what's wrong with the school system, an element that is immediately apparent to any foreigner who comes into contact with it: the harshness of the classroom culture.
"It's a culture you can sum up as T'es nul (You're worthless). You hear these words all the time in France."
