The health booklet showed a smiling young boy clearly anxious to grow taller. Next to him was a young girl measuring her waist and frowning. So far, so sexist.
What has shocked French feminists, however, is that the picture was used as a cover for the official Carnet de Santé, the health books given to mothers of all newborns to record the childâs development, by a local authority.
Now the Bouches-du-Rhône council has been forced to withdraw the offending books and reprint them at a cost of â¬33,000.

Health officials acted after the campaign group Osez Le Féminisme (Dare to be Feminist) declared it was âparticularly shockedâ by the picture and lambasted health officials for âcultivating sexual stereotypes among children and their parentsâ.
âSexual stereotypes are present in our daily lives at various levels; they are insidious and allow ordinary sexism to continue. They must be fought so we can build a true equality between women and men,â the group said in a statement.
âBeauty demands made on girls these days is excessively heavy and is present in practically all advertising with retouched photographs showing an unattainable model of beauty.â
It added it was surprised that the local authority could âignore the complexes and eating disordersâ such images provoke.
Campaigners also pointed out that paediatricians rarely measure a childâs waist except in cases of clinical obesity.
The Bouches-du-Rhône council said the picture had been chosen by a previous administration and agreed the image was âinappropriate given the public health concerns linked with the fight against anorexia in young girlsâ.
It said the book was being withdrawn and a new one would be produced âas soon as possibleâ.
However, Philippe Bilger, an honorary magistrate, told Le Figaro it was an outrageous âwaste of moneyâ and hit out at what he called the âoverblown and militant anti-sexism about everything and nothingâ.
âWhat is this imperious necessity that obliges us to waste â¬33,000? Just for daring to show characteristics that are an everyday reality is enough to throw health booklets in the bin â¦ the world has been turned on its head,â he wrote. 
Previous health books issued by the Bouches-du-Rhône council, posted on Twitter, show girls playing football.
