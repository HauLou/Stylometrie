A 64-year-old woman was seriously injured after leaping from the sixth floor of a burning hotel residence in the French ski resort Val d'Isère on Monday.

At least four other people were taken to hospital, most of them suffering from smoke inhalation. More than 150 people were evacuated from the mainly wood-constructed building and children were ordered to leave a nearby primary school.
Three seasonal workers initially reported missing were later found safe and well.

Sixty firefighters tackled the blaze, which reportedly started on the fifth floor of the nine story building.


It occurred just days before the start of the winter school holidays â the height of the season for French ski resorts, which are packed with temporary workers, many from Britain.

The building was reportedly used by dozens of temporary ski resort workers, according to local mayor Marc Bauer.

Benoît Launey, director of the local Val d'Isère TV and radio station, said he saw people leaving the hotel. "Some of them came out with just a towel around their waist. They have lost everything," he told BFMTV.

An appeal, in French and English, was put out for clothes and shelter for those who were evacuated.
