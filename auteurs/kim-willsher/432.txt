On Sunday, party officials joined in the chorus to play down the accident in which Le Pen apparently damaged her sacrum, the large triangular bone at the base of the spine that joins the lowest spinal vertebrae, the coccyx and the two hip bones.
Le Pen was reported to have slipped into the pool while mowing the lawn at her country home near Perpignan a week ago.
"Don't panic! Fracture of the sacrum last weekend. It will be long, it's painful, but nothing dramatic!" Le Pen tweeted on Saturday.
The accident came to light after Le Pen's father, Jean-Marie, founder of the FN, stood in for his daughter at the launch of the party's municipal and European election campaign in Limoges on Saturday.
Explaining her absence, he told the gathering: "Marine couldn't come because she has had a quite serious accident that prevents her from travelling. She fell into her empty swimming pool and has fractured her spinal column."
A party spokesman, Alain Vizier, said on Sunday that Mr Le Pen had "dramatised" the incident, adding that the Front National leader "was fine". "Marine Le Pen slipped, that's all," Vizier said.
FN officials said the injury would limit Le Pen's travelling, but would not stop her taking part in meetings, press conferences and interviews.
"It means a slight lightening of her workload, but will not prevent her from continuing her activities," said a party statement. "We would like to reassure party activists and supporters about the state of the [party] president's health and thank you for the numerous messages of sympathy she has received."
