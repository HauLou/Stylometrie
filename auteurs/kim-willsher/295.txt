The editor of France's Libération daily newspaper has resigned, after journalists went on strike, saying he believes he is part of the problem. Nicolas Demorand had been embroiled in a dispute with newsroom staff opposed to the vision of the leftwing paper's future that he proposed in conjunction with shareholders.
Demorand, who took over as editor in March 2011, was stung by a vote of no confidence by journalists in November. He said he hoped his decision to stand down would open the way to constructive negotiations to resolve the crisis.
"Libération is in a deep crisis. I hope my departure will enable the two sides to rediscover the way forward through talks," Demorand told Le Monde on Thursday.
"I've taken this decision because I think it's necessary to unblock the situation in which Libé finds itself, with a clear clash between the editorial staff and some of the shareholders. I've had to deal with severe crises during my three years at Libération," he said, "but it's the first time that it seems clear that it's me who has to go."
Last Friday, after a 24-hour strike, journalists were stunned to learn of a plan by shareholders to revamp the paper's Paris headquarters into a conference venue and cultural centre in association with the designer Philippe Starck. The proposals included setting up a television and radio studio, as well as a restaurant and bar.
Newsroom staff responded by producing a front page declaring: "We are a newspaper â¦ not a restaurant, not a social network, not a cultural space, not a television studio, not a bar and not an incubator for startups."
Libération was co-founded by the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre in 1973 as a voice for the people and as an antidote to "supine" journalism. The first issue of the paper on 18 April 1973 had only four pages. It became fondly known as Libé to its loyal but dwindling readership.
Journalists said the shareholders' plan suggested many ways of making money from the Libération trademark and building, but made no mention of journalism.
Demorand's resignation comes three months after a gunman opened fire in the Paris headquarters of the newspaper, critically wounding a photographer's assistant.
Demorand told Le Monde he had spent the past three years looking for money to keep the paper afloat and pay salaries as sales of the newspaper dropped. Several times he thought it might have to close, leaving him to "put the key under the door".
He said journalists had refused to accept plans to "completely rebuild" Libération into a multimedia organisation centred on the newspaper, which he believed was essential for its future.
"Libération is still a business dominated by 'print first'. For the past three years, my idea has been to take the paper into the digital age and profoundly transform our way of working."
He added: "The Guardian has a cafe, but it is first and foremost a very great newspaper and a very great website. Diversifying is necessary for the written press today because it [a paper] cannot survive alone, but it cannot be just done around a strong paper and website. Peripheral activities have to be used in the production of quality journalism. This is why I suggested the idea of opening our building to the public, while keeping the newsroom in place."
Demorand said he had not returned to the paper since journalists "censored" one of his statements last Friday. He added: "I'm going while at the same time hoping that my departure will help the Libé team and this irreplaceable newspaper."

Nicolas Cori, a journalist and union representative at Libération, said staff were "extremely worried" about their future and that of the paper.
"We cannot even discuss anything with the shareholders. It's as if we are from different planets," he said.
"The bottom line is they want the journalists to move out so they can turn Libération into a cultural space. We are not opposed per se to the plans to diversity, but what shocked us is that Libération was to be reconstructed without journalists.
"Where is the journalism, the reporters, the newspaper in all this? We have asked, but we've had no answer. It is unthinkable to us that you can transform Libération into something without journalists."
Cori vehemently rejected criticism that staff at the paper had not moved into the digital age.
"They have accused the Libération journalists of being behind with the times and not innovative but we are not like that in the least.
"We were the first French newspaper to have a website, we have tried to diversify into money making projects, we have tried to initiate projects and have come up with our own suggestions and ideas. The great weakness is that there is very little money, and the paper is under-capitalised, so our ideas come to nothing."
He added: "The shareholders have the money but no interest in journalism. All we are saying is talk to us about journalism and we can talk."
