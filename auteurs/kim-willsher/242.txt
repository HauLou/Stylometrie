An adviser to François Hollande has resigned after he was accused of a past conflict of interest and of behaving like a champagne socialist.
Aquilino Morelle, who was in charge of Hollande's communications, was alleged to have worked in secret for a pharmaceutical company while also engaged by a health watchdog.
Almost as damaging were claims that his lifestyle was not that expected of someone seen as representing the left wing of the Socialist party.
The investigative website Mediapart alleged that Morelle had summoned a shoe-shiner to the presidential palace to buff his 30 pairs of handmade leather shoes, used official chauffeurs to drive his children to after-school activities, and raided the Elysée cellars for fine vintage wines to accompany his working lunches.He was also alleged to have passed off presidential speeches written by another adviser as his own.
Morelle did not contest the allegations about his shoes and confirmed that the two chauffeurs at his disposal were sometimes asked to pick up his son from school because of his extremely busy schedule.
"I wish to say again that I have committed no fault. I have never been in a situation creating a conflict of interests," he said on his Facebook page, adding that he was standing down to be "completely free to respond to these attacks".
An official inquiry was launched into Mediapart's claim that Morelle secretly worked for a Danish pharmaceutical laboratory, Lundbeck, in 2007 while he was an inspector with the general inspectorate for health affairs, Igas.
Morelle claimed Igas knew of his connection to the laboratory, saying his activities had been "declared". However, an Igas spokesperson said it had no record of any request for authorisation. André Nutte, the head of Igas at the time, said he did not remember giving permission.
"At the very least, it sounds like a conflict of interests," Nutte told RTL. "Someone cannot be tasked with an inspection and control while at the same time offering assistance to a company that is part of the control."
Jean-Christophe Cambadélis, the newly elected head of Hollande's Socialist party, called on Morelle to explain himself. "If it's not true he must explain himself, and it has to be a good explanation so we can understand. He must do this quickly," he said.
Morelle, 51, a qualified doctor and the son of working-class immigrants, told Liberation in 1999: "I live like a bourgeois, but I will never be part of the bourgeoisie. My children, perhaps, but not me. Never."
During a scandal in 2011 when authorities were accused of being too close to pharmaceutical companies, leading to the continued use of a drug called Mediator despite safety concerns, Morelle said: "Everyone has to be clear. It is not forbidden for doctors to have a relationship with the pharmaceutical industry, but it is necessary that they make this publicly known.
"What we hope is that these links are known. When you make known your relationship, you are transparent. Experts who are judge and jury â¦ it's no longer possible. It has to stop."
