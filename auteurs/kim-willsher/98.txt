The French rail operator SNCF has been accused of sexism after advising staff on how to use âdiscreetâ lipstick and perfume and what mascara to wear.
In an internal document on new uniforms, the company suggests several âindispensable beauty tipsâ, including that staff use hand cream, put on âhealthy-looking blusherâ and choose subtle jewellery.
âYour hands are often sought so take care of them! Donât hesitate to moisturise them regularly and dress them soberly with a transparent, pastel pink or red nail varnish,â the document states. âSimple and careful makeup is strongly recommended (foundation, eyes, lips, cheeks). Lipstick should match blusher.â
After the 36-page document was leaked on Twitter, SNCF rejected accusations of discrimination, pointing out that it also contained advice for male staff.
âA beard and a moustache are fashionable: if you choose this style please keep them clean or choose a regular shave,â the document states. âChoose a deodorant or a light and subtle perfume.â
SNCF told Le Figaro newspaper: âItâs only advice on how to approve appearances to make our service to customers the most professional possible. Thereâs nothing obligatory in it.â
Le Figaro noted that the documentâs advice for female staff was highlighted in pink and for male employees in blue.
