The executive director of a prestigious Paris journalism school has been suspended after being accused of plagiarism.
Agnès Chauveau was reported to have cut and pasted parts of articles that had appeared in Le Monde and other French publications for her columns published on the Huffington Post website.
Bruno Patino, director of the school at the respected Institute of Political Sciences, known as Sciences Po, wrote to students and staff on Monday saying the allegations could not be taken lightly. âPlagiarism is a serious matter in journalism,â he said in an email.
Patino, who is also a director of programmes at Chauveau, who has a doctorate in history and specialises in media history, was accused of lifting the material, originally used in her one-hour weekly radio broadcast Soft Power on the France Culture station, from online and printed publications without attribution.
While this might have gone unnoticed on the radio, a column based on the broadcast appeared on the Huffington Post a few days later.
The alleged plagiarism was uncovered by the news website Arrêt Sur Images (ASI) after it complained that Chauveau had used material from one of its articles about the future of the press on digital tablets, without citing its original research.
After contacting the broadcaster, which immediately added a link to the original article in her Huffington Post article, ASI said it ran an online plagiarism check of about 20 of Chauveauâs columns.
It claimed it found that half of them contained at least one sentence directly lifted from the articles of other journalists, but some had two or three sentences that were used unchanged and were not attributed to the original author.
ASI sourced the unattributed material to the investigative website Mediapart, to radio RFI, to the online and paper editions of Le Monde and even to its own website. It described Chauveau as a âserial copierâ.
Contacted by ASI, Chauveau said she had âforgotten to cite certain papers, but never on purposeâ, and insisted: âIâve rectified this each time thereâs been a problemâ.
She said she did not âhave time to cite all her sources on the radioâ.
Sciences Po journalism students are required to sign a charter that states they should âcommit no plagiarism or pass anyone elseâs ideas as their own, and must explicitly quote their colleagues whose written work they reproduce, even if it is just a few words of textâ. Studentsâ theses are reportedly checked for plagiarism.
Around 400 students have graduated from the journalism school at Sciences Po, the university where many French politicians and leaders, including François Hollande, have studied.
