The Iraqi-born British engineer assassinated at an Alpine beauty spot a year ago kept dozens of hours of recordings of conversations that reveal the level of "hatred" and "violence" between him and his brother Zaid, a suspect, French police said.
Saad al-Hilli was murdered near the village of Chevaline in the Haute Savoie, along with his wife, mother-in-law, and a passing cyclist. French police described the killer as a "hardened gunman".
The Hillis' elder daughter Zainab, then seven, was left for dead with severe head injuries, while her younger sister, Zeena, four, hid under her dead mother's skirts in the family car.
Eric Maillaud, the prosecutor, said on Friday the documents in the case ran to "cubic metres". French police have interviewed around 800 witnesses and taken 3,000 statements. UK police said they had taken 560 statements , 1,600 exhibits, carried out 2,000 "actions" and had 1,300 reports.
The inquiry, which has led to 80 "international demands" for police assistance in 20 countries, has been officially extended for another year.
Maillaud added: "This affair is very complex and international. What we need is proof and not scenarios or hypotheses. We need something that will stand up before a jury."
French police say Saad al-Hilli, 50, came on holiday with his family to a camping site carrying an extraordinary amount of documentation as well as hard drives, computers and audio recordings relating to the dispute with his brother over their late father's estate, estimated at around â¬4-5m.
Colonel Benoït Vinnemann, who is leading the inquiry, said many of the recordings were in Arabic but they showed the level of suspicion and hatred between the two brothers and the depth of the conflict, which investigators described as "almost an obsession" for Saad al-Hilli.
At a press conference on Friday, both French and British police, who are working together on the case, admitted they still have "no exact idea" who may have carried out the killings, except that he was a "hardened gunman".
The gunman, using an obsolete pre-war Swiss-made Luger P06 7.65mm Parabellum, fired 21 times, including twice into the heads of the three members of the Hilli family and five times into the cyclist, Syvain Mollier. The killer shot from outside the vehicle, a maroon-coloured BMW estate, shattering the windows, but without scratching the bodywork. In all, 17 of the shots hit a human target.
With each gun magazine carrying eight bullets, the assassin would have had to recharge the weapon at least twice.
"I would not use the term professional gunmanâ¦but he was certainly what I would call a hardened gunman, experienced in situations of stress," Maillaud said.
He dismissed newspaper reports that the victims were gunned down by a hit-man from the former Yugoslavia as "pure speculation" and said the idea of a "lone wolf" killer or that the Hillis had stumbled across a drug or arms deal as "still being investigated, but is lower down the list of hypotheses".
"All we know is that there was one killer and he knew what he was doing: he was able to hit a moving target and change magazines, but we have no idea of his exact profile," Maillaud said.
The prosecutor said that one year on, the two main lines of inquiry centred on the dispute between Saad al-Hilli and his brother Zaid over the estate of their late father Khadem, who died in 2011 in Spain, and the possibility that Saad, who worked as an engineer on civil satellites may have been killed in an act of "industrial espionage".
Maillaud said Saad al-Hilli, who lived in Claygate, Surrey, and worked at Guildford-based Surrey Satellite Technologies, had "more information related to his work than one would have expected of someone in his position".
"Saad worked as an engineer for a company that was involved in satellites, but these were mainly for civil use, the weather, traffic, etc. However, we found he did have more information than his job justified.
"We are working with a number of foreign countries to find out if any secret services were involved, but who knows. It is a complex inquiry and maybe this lead will go nowhere."
However, it was clear that the reportedly tempestuous, even "violent", relationship between the Hilli brothers was the most interesting and perplexing for investigators on both sides of the Channel. Zaid, who was arrested by Surrey police in June and released on police bail until October, has vehemently denied having anything to do with the killings.
He has also insisted he and his brother had not fallen out over their father's estate. Investigators say the telephone recordings and documentary evidence, as well as statements from relatives and friends suggests otherwise.
"The conflict is interesting to the inquiry. How many people go on holiday with all these documents and audio material? Saad recorded almost all his telephone conversations with his family and friends," Vinnemann said.
"It is through these recordings, hours and hours of them, that we are able to understand the character and personality of Saad and his brother and other members of the family. These are taking time to go through as we have had to seek out all the Arab speakers in the gendarmerie, but they are very interesting elements for us."

"We know there was a violent conflict between the two brothers over their father Khadem's inheritance and we have partial information about that inheritance because it has proven very difficult for us to go to Iraq, where some of the family property is held, to investigate," Maillaud said.
"We know, from speaking to members of the family, that Saad was afraid of his brother Zaid. We know there were threats between the brothers."
The audio recordings that Saad al-Hilli made showed the "degree of hatred" that existed between the two brothers at the time of the killings.
Maillaud added: "The conflict between the two brothers over the inheritance could be considered a motive. Zaid is considered a suspect, but no more than that. We cannot say more than that and we cannot even say he is a prime suspect.
"If there was a killing every time there was a family dispute about money there wouldn't be many people left."
"[Saad] appeared to be trying to show that his brother had stolen a part of their father's estate. This was clearly a preoccupation."
Detective Superintendent Nick May of Surrey and Sussex major crime squad, said police had established where Zaid al-Hilli was on the day of the killings and "he was not in France".
Asked whether Zaid al-Hilli knew how to shoot, May replied: "That is between him and the police."
It was around 15.30 on 5 September 2012 that former RAF officer Brett Martin, cycling up the Route de la Combe d'Ire near the village of Chevaline, came across an unimaginable scene.
A maroon BMW estate car, its engine turning and wheels spinning in reverse, was embedded in a mud bank. A barely-conscious little girl with blood pouring from severe head wounds was stumbling about in a daze.
As Zainab al-Hilli, aged seven, collapsed at his feet Martin put her in the recovery position, saving her life. Near the car was the body of a French cyclist, Sylvain Mollier, a 45-year-old father of three whose only crime appears to have been being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Thinking it was a car accident, Martin smashed the driver's side window to turn off the car. Inside the vehicle he saw the bodies of Saad al-Hilli, his dentist wife Iqbal, 47, and her mother Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, both also born in Iraq, each shot twice in the head.

On Friday, Maillaud said there was no trace of the killer's DNA at the crime scene and that Zainab al-Hilli remained the only witness.
"She is the only living person, apart from the killer, who saw the murders. Unfortunately she was profoundly traumatised and brought nothing to the inquiry except to tell us there was only one gunman.
"We have carried out lots of forensic examinations and there is no usable DNA to lead us to another human being at the scene. This is part of the difficulty of the inquiry."
He said police had identified all other people and vehicles who were in the area at the time, but were still looking for a white motorbike and a dark-coloured 4x4 vehicle â possibly a BMW â that witnesses reported seeing.
Detectives are also trawling through mobile phone records picked up by the local relay station, which Maillaud said was a long and painstaking task. Neither the French nor British police would comment on reports that Zaid al-Hilli had made calls from his Surrey home to Romania before the murders.

Maillaud said detectives had "almost completely ruled out" that the real victim of the killings was Sylvain Mollier. Mollier worked as a welder for the French nuclear giant Areva and was on paternity leave at the time of the shootings.
"We have the deep conviction that he was a witness to these events â¦ that he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time."
He insisted, as he has in the past, that while "no leads" have been completely ruled out, detectives were "orientated" towards the theory that the killings were either linked to the Hilli family dispute and Iraqi connections or industrial espionage, connected with Saad al-Hilli's work.
"We believe Saad al-Hilli was planning to go to Switzerland (where his father had placed money). He was trying to show his brother had stolen a large part of their father's estate. He was afraid of him (Zaid), one of the reasons he had changed the alarm at his house (in Claygate, Surrey).
"Zaid was the eldest son and he had controlled the father's estate. Saad was convinced he had used this to his advantage. And we have the testaments, in one of which Zaid was the only heir. It seems Zaid wanted to profit from his father's fortune and get his hands on the major part and this had created a hatred between the two brothers.
"We also have to try to understand the honour values of a family that are different to those that we understand."
"There is a question of whether the person at the head of the family fortune in Iraq might want both brothers to disappear because they wanted to obtain the family fortune."
Asked if there was a conflict between the French and British investigators, Maillaud said they had a "shared determination to find the killer".
May from the Surrey and Sussex police said Zaid al-Hilli was a "nominated suspect".
Exactly one year and one day ago, at a similar press conference â this time without the British police presence â Maillaud admitted his greatest concern.
"My biggest worry is that we will never find the killer or killers; that we will never know what happened," the prosecutor told journalists.
Today, 366 days on, Maillaud's fears are being realised.
"Yes, one year on it is still a fear, but we are doing our best. We hope, for the sake of the victims and their families, that we will find the killer. But it is always possible we won't. Unfortunately, that is life," he said.
