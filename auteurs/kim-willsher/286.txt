A French former tennis star turned musician, Yannick Noah, has enlisted the services of two other national heroes to release a song aimed against the far-right Front National (FN).
Noah, who is regularly voted France's favourite famous person, has released the song Ma Colère (my anger) accompanied by a video featuring former footballer turned actor and photographer Eric "The King" Cantona and singer-songwriter Bruno Caliciuri (known as Cali), whose Italian grandfather fought with the international brigades against Franco
The clip for Ma Colère, the second track on Noah's album to be released in June, shows the former sportsman dancing barefoot and bare-chested under his white suit, to flashes of the red, white and blue of the French Tricolore. "My anger is not a front, my anger is not national because my anger is honoured to fight theirs," he sings.
The centre-right Le Figaro newspaper said the timing, just three weeks from local elections, was no mistake. "The former king of the smash has gathered the trademarked big mouths of the media bandwagon," it wrote, describing the clip's release in the middle of the election campaign as a "song pamphlet".
"Yannick Noah has never hidden his penchant for socialist ideas," added Le Figaro. It pointed out that Noah had publicly declared his support for France's Socialist leader François Hollande during the 2012 presidential campaign. "His [Noah's] attachment to the ideology of the left is such that he was one of the rare 'rich and famous' personalities to defend the 75% tax rate," Le Figaro added.
FN leader Marine Le Pen described the song as being in poor taste. "The words are pretty bad. As for this elevator music â¦ I'm not sure it will sell," she told French journalists during a visit to Angers in western Noah, 53, won 23 singles titles and 16 doubles titles during a career in which he rose to No3 in the world singles ranking and No1 in the doubles ranking. He has since founded a charity for underprivileged children and is the father of Joakim Noah who plays for the NBA Chicago Bulls.
Fans of King Eric are advised not to blink or they will miss Cantona, filmed glaring into the middle distance, for all of two seconds.
