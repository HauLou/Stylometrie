That Now one of the former president's most high-profile supporters and confidantes, the former first lady Bernadette Chirac, has confirmed Sarkozy is planning a return to the political fray.
Asked by Pressed as to whether she had inside information, she said: "Ah, but I'm not allowed to say it," before finally admitting that Sarkozy had spoken to her and was indeed planning to stand in 2017.
"Well obviously," she told the radio station, adding: "But, he's going to tell me off for this."
Chirac, whose husband Jacques was president between 1995 and 2007 when he was succeeded by Sarkozy, has made little secret of her hopes of seeing the centre-right candidate make a comeback. While Sarkozy has refused to comment, he has indicated to friends that he is inclined to stand for a second term in office in 2017.
He recently reactivated his Instagram account and published a photograph of himself drinking coffee in a Paris café â his first posting since the debate with Hollande between the two rounds of the presidential election in May 2012. "Happy New Year to the businesses of the area and thanks for the coffee," he wrote.
Sarkozy has more than 900,000 likes on his Facebook page. On Christmas Eve, he left a message thanking fans for their "support, friendship and loyalty".
Shortly before he was beaten by Hollande in May 2012 by a small majority, Sarkozy had promised that if defeated he would withdraw from public life. "I will rebuild my life completely. You will never hear from me again if I am beaten," he told French journalists invited to the Elysée.
Few were taken in, though iIn the immediate aftermath of his defeat, Sarkozy and his wife, the supermodel turned singer Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, did indeed remain out of the limelight.
However, within months of leaving office, friends who had met the former president were hinting of a comeback. Rumours of an eventual return to politics have grown steadily louder ever since. Friends have suggested he will go public with his intention to fight the revenge match with Hollande in the summer of this year.
He is helped by the fact that nobody in the centre right UMP party, which underwent a disastrous leadership tussle in 2012, has emerged to replace him. Successive polls over the last year have shown that Sarkozy remains the candidate of choice for centre-right voters, though other surveys have shown the wider French electorate less sympathetic to the man who was dismissed as "President Bling-Bling" for his flashy lifestyle. An opinion poll by IFOP in September last year suggested 76% of French people were dissatisfied with Hollande as president, but three years is a long time in politics.
Sarkozy has always let it be known that the only thing that would persuade him back would be his "duty to France". "The question is not to know if I want to return, it's whether I cannot NOT return. I don't have the choice," he told Le Point magazine.
Chirac has not always been a Sarkozy fan. When he supported one of her husband's political rivals, Edouard Balladur, in the 1995 presidential election, the Chiracs felt betrayed and humiliated, especially as Sarkozy had previously been romantically involved with their daughter Claude. Mme Chirac was said to have remarked then: "And to think, he has seen us in our night-clothes â¦"
In her radio interview, Chirac said she had written to Valérie Trierweiler, who is recovering from the shock of hearing claims that Hollande has been secretly meeting a French actress, Julie Gayet. Trierweiler spent 10 days in hospital in "deep despair" and shock after the alleged affair was revealed by the celebrity magazine Closer.
Hollande has refused to comment on the reports, but has said he will "clarify" Trierweiler's role before a state visit to Washington on 11 February. The president and his official partner were invited to meet Barack and Michelle Obama.
Trierweiler is "resting" at La Lanterne, an official state residence near Versailles.
"The president of the republic himself said that private matters have to be sorted out in private, so this is nothing to do with me," Chirac said, adding that she had not telephoned Trierweiler because, "I don't want to be indiscreet. She is probably very tired if she was at hospital. But I wrote her a little note. I said I felt for her sadness. I said it would sort itself out quite quickly. I think she is sad, and that's obvious from the news we are given."
