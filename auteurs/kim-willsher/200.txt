The president of the French football club that lost its new female manager just hours before a first training session, blamed it on her being a woman on Tuesday.
In an astonishing response that will spark accusations of sexism, Claude Michy, president of the second division Clermont Foot 63, said: âSheâs a woman so it could be down to any number of things â¦â
The Portuguese-born Helena Costa, 36, who became the first female coach of a French professional menâs team, had refused to say why she was walking out on the club at a press conference on Tuesday.
Immediately after she left the room, however, Michyâs declarations took a different tone. He insisted the reason for Costaâs decision was a mystery.
âItâs an astonishing, irrational and incomprehensible decision. Sheâs developed a confidence problem, but I donât know what it was that caused this,â he told journalists.
âShe told me quite simply: âIâm going,â and we didnât succeed in making her change her mind. Sheâs taking her secret with her.â
The appointment of Costa last month was seen as a watershed in the macho world of football. She was previously the coach of the Iranian womenâs team and was nicknamed âMourinho in a skirtâ, after a period of work experience at Chelsea when her compatriot José Mourinho was manager.
Costa announced she was resigning and decided to return to Portugal on Monday. She was due to oversee the teamâs first training session on Tuesday.
âUntil now Iâve totally honoured by commitments, but after a discussion with the president, Iâve decided to leave. Itâs my own decision,â she said.
