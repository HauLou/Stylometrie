Bored and exiled in the pine forests of rural Bohemia, far from the cities and the women he had loved and left, the ageing Giacomo Casanova spent his final years writing his memoirs. The Venice he grew up in no longer existed. The Paris he loved was riddled with revolution. Writing was, he said in the preface, "the only remedy I could think of to keep me from going mad or dying of grief".
The book, However, a new book from French publisher Laffont, coming out in late April, aims to reveal Casanova in his full glory. It is based on the original 3,682-page manuscript, acquired by the Bibliothèque Nationale de Jean-Christophe Igalens, a lecturer at Nice University and a specialist on Casanova, who co-produced the book, said it reveals the notorious libertine as "a much more complex character than the cliche he has become. Yes, he was a seducer, but he was also seduced. He loved women, the women he had affairs with. He wasn't just a superficial character who took a woman to bed then left her. He had rich relationships with women," Igalens told the In 1821, 23 years after Casanova died, the manuscript of Even so, it seduced French writers, among them Henri Beyle, better known as Stendhal, and Alfred de Musset, the poet and dramatist.

The original manuscript was almost lost for ever when the offices of Brockhaus took a direct hit from an Allied bomb in 1943. Winston Churchill is reported to have inquired as to its fate. Almost miraculously, it emerged unscathed and was rushed to a bank security vault.
In 1960 the original manuscript was published in its entirety in the original French, followed by an English version in 1966. "The problem was that it [the French version] was published in a hurry and there were many errors and faults in the transcription," Igalens said. "This edition is more serious. There is no shock discovery that will change our image of Casanova, but what makes this new and special are the variants and pages that are completely different."
Igalens cites the account of Casanova's first visit to Paris in 1750, when he writes about visiting a "In the new transcription we have much more detail; it is more precise. Casanova describes the women in the The new book publishes the two versions of Casanova opens his memoirs with: "I begin by declaring to my reader that in all that I have done throughout my life, good or bad, I am sure that I have earned merit or blame, and as a consequence I believe myself free.
"Man is free, but he is only free if he believes himself to be â¦ The only system I have had ... is that of letting myself go where the blowing wind took me."
