François Hollande was in a talkative mood. He talked about the economy, French hostages, the health system, Mali and the Central African Republic â everything under the French sun and the crystal chandeliers of the Elysée Palace's opulent and gilded Salle des Fêtes. There was no subject that did not merit a long discourse.
Except one â his alleged affair with French actor Julie Gayet. Finally, after more than 40 minutes of Hollande monologue, came the first question, posed as tradition dictates by the president of the French Presidential Press Association, currently Alain Barluet of the centre-right Le Figaro.
French journalists sucked in their breath, winced and ducked behind their laptops. Would Barluet pull the trigger?
First he thanked the president politely for his seasonal greetings to the press, then reciprocated on behalf of the assembled journalists, next noting awkwardly that the revelation of Hollande's alleged affair in a celebrity magazine had caused "considerable commotion at home and abroad", before finally getting round to asking, since the president and his partner are due to be visiting the United States next month: "Is Valérie Trierweiler still France's first lady?"
The president drew breath; 500 pairs of eyes were fixed on his bobbing Adam's apple.
"I understand your question," the president said stiffly. "And I am sure you will understand my response. Everyone goes through difficult, painful periods in their lives and that is our case.
"I have one principle: private affairs are dealt with in private and with respect for privacy of others. This is not the time or place and I will not respond nor answer any question today."
He did pledge to "clear up the confusion" over the role of Trierweiler, who is due to accompany him on the trip, before travelling to America. But not now.
Closer magazine's revelations could not have come at a worse time for Hollande. Tuesday's conference, the third since he took power in May 2012, was also the occasion of his traditional new year wishes to the press, who were surely the last people he wanted to face.
"The problem is that Hollande doesn't have a spin doctor like Alastair Campbell," said one French reporter, referring to Tony Blair's media pitbull.
However, the man they once cruelly nicknamed Mr Flanby, after a wobbly and bland blancmange-like desert, the man the opposition accuses of political vacillation and indecision, showed he could indeed show resolve when it was called for.
As the Elysée's media team tried to make sure only certain journalists, presumably those unlikely to wade in with more personal questions, were allowed within reach of a microphone, reporters turned themselves inside-out trying to ask the question without asking it.
One journalist said he would not ask a private question, but asked if the president thought the country's notoriously tough privacy laws needed tightening.
"No," said Hollande tersely. "I am protected, but my indignation is total. TOTAL," he almost shouted. "This isn't just about me, it touches all of you. It touches a fundamental freedom: the respect for private life and dignity."
How was Trierweiler? asked another in the full knowledge that the first lady has been in hospital, reportedly suffering from shock and "the blues" since learning of her partner's alleged infidelity. "She is resting. I have nothing else to say," replied Hollande.
Could he guarantee his security was not compromised during his clandestine trysts with Gayet? "My security is assured. Everywhere. You don't need to worry about that," he said, admitting all the same that there was "slightly less security" for his private visits.
The position of first lady holds no legal status in On other matters, Hollande was loquacious. He spoke of what he had achieved over the past 18 months and what he intended to do in the next three years: boosting growth by reducing charges and red tape for businesses in exchange for them creating more jobs; cutting public spending by â¬15bn this year and then a further â¬50bn, equivalent to 4% of France's GDP, by 2017; employment opportunities for youngsters; and ending the "excess and abuse" in the country's envied but costly health system.
He hardly stopped to draw breath as he covered antisemitism, Islamophobia, racism and xenophobia, which he said would "not be tolerated", and French military operations in Mali and the Central African Republic, and threw out a "surprise" of a possible military alliance with Germany. He also had a dig at David Cameron, saying "those who want to finish with the European ideal" would not be allowed to destroy it, and at the UK government's fears over a "flood" of immigrants arriving from Romania and Bulgaria after recent EU rule changes.
"We have to avoid contradictory discussions that on one side welcomed an enlarged And he spoke of the future of France.
"Where will be be in ten years. Will we be a big country that takes its place in the world, that has it's place and takes decision. Or will be be a country that looks at others, that complains and runs itself down...that doesn't have confidence. Non, non, France must understand she has a great destiny if she is prepared for it," he said.
After almost three hours, one foreign journalist from Associated Press had one last go, in light of the forthcoming US visit at the subject that had become the elephant in the room: did the scandal affect his image?
Hollande's response was icy. "In France we have a certain number of principles. They are respect for private lives and our liberty and conception of the press. That is what we have â¦ a certain number of values and principles."
After turning move-along-nothing-to-see into an art form, Hollande, known for his sense of humour, left with a nod to the hungry press pack. "Thank you for your presence, your patience and also your frustration for not being able to ask all your questions." And with that he turned on his heels and left.
