So far, the challenges of being the first woman to run the French capital have included defying the French language police to be called Madame La Maire (and not the grammatically correct masculine "le Maire") and being instructed by the protocol police not to wear trousers to meet the Queen on a recent state visit. Unusually for her, she wore a dress. Asked if she was ordered to curtsey, she laughs: "I'm a good republican. I don't have to."
In her first interview with a foreign newspaper, the Spanish-born, French-naturalised Hidalgo is warm, open and charming. Yet one interviewer said her voice could send you to sleep and she is often regarded as autocratic, the town hall equivalent of France's big socialist boss, President François "Monsieur Normal" Hollande. "People want responsible politicians who are themselves, and I am who I am," is her riposte. "I don't play a role. If I'd wanted to, I'd have gone into the cinema or theatre â¦ which, come to think of it, might have been fun, but was not my path."
Relatively unknown outside the gilded corridors of the hôtel de ville before emerging as the designated successor of the hugely popular socialist mayor Bertrand Delanoë, Hidalgo maintains a no-nonsense approach to celebrity. "I haven't changed and neither has my life. I have my family and the same friends and I still take my son to school. If the celebrity press wants to take pictures of me pushing a trolley around the supermarket, well, I'm not sure it will sell tabloids."
These comments mark a back-to-business approach for Hidalgo after a brutal and closely run mayoral election between two women that at times appeared to focus too much on image at the expense of policy. Though the socialist Hidalgo never appeared in Paris Match wearing a party gown deep in a forest, unlike her centre-right rival Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, her campaign photo was nonetheless criticised for being airbrushed.
Hidalgo says that her first priority as newly elected mayor is righting inequalities across the city by means of affordable housing. Trying to combat the city's historic socio-economic east-west divide, the divide at the heart of Victor Hugo's Les Misérables, is a lofty ideal. It is also likely to be met with opposition from the leaders of the city's wealthy western arrondissements, who in the past have resorted to France's plodding legal system to block attempts to create council houses on their patch.
"The social mix of classes comes about through housing and we need more council housing in the west of Paris," says Hidalgo, whose power does not stretch to the run-down outer city banlieues. "This was a campaign promise and I have made this my objective."
Immigration and inequality are subjects that Hidalgo can talk about with some authority. Her paternal grandfather fled General Franco's fascist Spain in 1937, taking his family on a donkey across the Pyrenees. Homesick, he returned two years later, but his wife died on the journey and he was jailed. His children, including Hidalgo's father, were placed in an orphanage and outcast as the "children of Reds".
Hidalgo's parents left for France in 1961 and settled in Lyon with their daughters when Ana, as she was then known, was just two years old. "For my father, Graduating with degrees in social services and law, she headed for Paris and a civil servant post as a works' inspector. After "retiring" as a bureaucrat, she became deputy mayor in 2001. She has a grownup son and daughter from a first marriage, and a 12-year-old son from her second. The whole family, including her parents, now in their 80s, and her older sister, who lives in the US, came to Paris for the mayoral campaign.
As she talks, Hidalgo gestures as if forming ideas with her hands, in a way one French journalist described as "like making pottery in the air". "The worst moment was waiting for the result. I was confident of winning right through the campaign until just before it was announced. Bertrand Delanoë, who is naturally pessimistic, had prepared me for the worse, saying perhaps I wouldn't win. Then he rang me that evening, just as I was having doubts, and said: 'You will be mayor of Paris.' Then the result fell and it was a liberation. It was just an enormous moment."
Just back from a visit to New York, where new Democratic mayor Bill de Blasio described her as a political soulmate, Hidalgo blew on the embers of Anglo-French hostility almost as soon as she was elected in January when she claimed, "London is a suburb of Paris", before adding the conciliatory, "and Paris is a suburb of London". Hidalgo says she is happy to come to London to see Boris Johnson. "Or perhaps Boris will come here. I met him many times when I was deputy mayor, he is â¦ er â¦ eccentric." Anxious not to create another international spat, she adds quickly: "This is, of course, a personality trait we like so much about you British."
Hidalgo says she likes to think that the London-Paris relationship is complementary; that seen from Shanghai, they are both equally worth a visit or an investment. "Of course we like the competitive edge, and that's normal and makes life so much more interesting. I know Boris likes to be competitive, but so do I." However different their vision of the competition itself, a Boris v Anne match is an interesting prospect.
