Love him or despise him â and there are plenty in both camps â Napoleon Bonaparte continues to inspire public fascination 193 years after his death.
On Sunday, some of the emperorâs last effects were auctioned at Fontainebleau on the outskirts of Paris, with some lots reaching 10 times the catalogue estimate.
The 1,000 lots ranged from the extraordinary (one of âOld Boneyââs bicorne hats and a lock of his hai) to the banal (a leather razor strop) and macabre (the kitchen knife with which student Friedrich Staps intended to kill the French emperor in 1809 as he was reviewing his troops in Vienna).
Many of the lots had returned to A white cotton shirt worn by the former emperor on St Helena, with a button missing and estimated at between â¬30,000 and â¬40,000, went under the hammer at â¬70,000 (£56,000). The leather razor strop from his toilet bag fetched â¬9,500.
Napoleonâs red leather wallet, estimated at â¬3,500, fetched â¬22,000, a gilt metal watch key estimated at â¬600 fetched â¬6,500 and a pair of red silk stockings estimated at â¬5,000 went for â¬15.000.
Locks of Napoleon and Josephineâs hair and a scrap of fabric stained with the emperorâs blood had been estimated at â¬2,000 but sold for â¬10,500.
The emperorâs famous bicorne cocked hat worn, contrary to the custom, parallel to the shoulders, was the star of the auction and roused those to applause when it was presented. It fetched â¬1.5m (£1.2m), nearly four times the estimated price. Bonaparte owned more than 100 of the hats, but only about 20 have survived, one of which is on display at the Musée des Invalides in Paris.
The objects, including bronzes and statues, were sold by the Monaco ruling family, the Grimaldis, in order to make room for a new museum dedicated to Princess Grace of Monaco, the former Hollywood actor Grace Kelly.
In a foreword in the auction catalogue, the principalityâs present ruler, Prince Albert, said he preferred to sell the objects than put them into storage.
