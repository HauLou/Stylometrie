The Manchester United forward strained his right thigh in training on Tuesday, limping out of the session to undergo treatment with the head physio, Gary Lewin, and despite scans revealing he had not sustained serious damage, he sat out the drills at Urca the following day. Welbeck travelled with the rest of the squad on Thursday and was able to take part in the gym work at the teamâs hotel upon arrival, with the 23-year-old confident he will be able to participate in the opening Group D fixture.
His availability will represent a considerable boost for Hodgson, who has utilised the forward regularly in his two years as manager. Welbeck may not be prolific for United â he has scored only once since 11 January â but he boasts a fine competitive record under the England had opted to work inside, out of the heat in Manaus, after draining sessions in Miami and Rio de Janeiro over the past fortnight on the advice of the squadâs medical and sports science staff. They will train at the stadium at 5.15pm on Friday, when temperatures are expected to be around 27C, to acclimatise for Saturdayâs 6pm (local time) start.
Björn Kuipers, who was in charge when Chelsea won the 2013 Europa League against Benfica and oversaw last monthâs Champions League final, will officiate the game in Manaus. The Dutchman refereed last summerâs Confederations Cup final, which Brazil won 3-0 against Spain with Gerard Piqué sent off, and also took charge of Franceâs victory over Ukraine, the co-hosts, at Euro 2012, taking the decision to suspend the game due to an electrical storm at the Donbass Arena.
He was also the referee who failed to spot Luis Suárez bite Otman Bakkalâs shoulder during a Dutch league game between Ajax and PSV Eindhoven in November 2010, but has gained a fine reputation within Uefa having been on their top tier of referees since January 2009. Kuipersâ assistants will be Sander von Roekel and Erwin Zeinstra. The fourth man is Walter López of Guatemala.
