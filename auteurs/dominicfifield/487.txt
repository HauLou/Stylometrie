Queens Park Rangers will return to the Premier League next season confident lessons have been learned from previous toils in the topflight, with the co-owner, The west London club gambled financially and made a loss of £65.4m while exiting the money-flushed elite in 2012-13, with their transfer policy muddled and increasingly desperate over the tenures of Mark Hughes and Redknapp. The incumbent manager had shipped out a number of high-profile players, including Christopher Samba, Loïc Rémy, Stéphane Mbia and José Bosingwa, in preparation for this termâs pursuit of promotion, with elevation achieved on Saturday courtesy of Bobby Zamoraâs last-minute goal against Derby County.
âBut we are smarter and wiser this time round,â said Fernandes, with his clubâs promotion effectively worth in excess of £80m given QPR will now forfeit parachute payments they would previously have received had they stayed in the second tier. âWe are not perfect. We are going to make some mistakes â even the biggest clubs in the world make mistakes â and it would be stupid to say we will not make mistakes again. But we are wiser and smarter and have the right kind of patrols in place.
âWill we fight the fine? What do you think? After all weâve been through, itâs my middle name: âFight itâ Fernandes. My view has been consistent: that it is very unfair for a club that has been relegated, as the wage difference between the Premier League and Championship is impossible. There should be a time period for clubs to rectify their salaries. If we were in the Championship in two years with that wage bill it wouldnât be right, and Iâm in favour of FFP, but it is unfair for a club coming down.â
Redknapp has already pinpointed potential arrivals to the owner. Interest likely to be registered in Fulhamâs Scott Parker as well as the out-of-contract pair Rio Ferdinand and Steve Sidwell. A number of his current squad are out of contract â including Zamora and Rob Green â while loanees will return to their parent clubs. There are a number of QPR players who will return to Loftus Road after their own loan deals, though Rémy, whose contract has an £8m buy-out clause, is expected to move on.
âWeâre not just going to bring players in willy-nilly,â said Redknapp. âWeâve got to make sure anyone who comes in is the right character and will come in and do a good job for the team. Thatâs all thatâs important. I donât see Rémy wanting to come back. Heâs talking about playing Champions League football somewhere and has a buy-out clause which is at a reasonable level. Mbiaâs done well at Sevilla, scoring in both legs of the [Europa League] semi-final. [Adel] Taarabtâs another, at AC Milan. What happens to him? We donât know.â
