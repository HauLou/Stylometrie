Crystal Palaceâs players have been urged to âmake their own historyâ as Pardew scored the extra-time winner in April 1990 as Steve Coppellâs Palace, who had been humiliated 9-0 in a top-flight fixture at Anfield the previous autumn, prevailed 4-3 at Villa Park to reach the only The manager has been nursing a sore throat and on the eve of the contest, sent his assistant Keith Millen â who had attended the FA Cup final replay defeat to Manchester United as a supporter â in his stead, though Pardew will be fit enough to sit on the bench. âIâm sure heâll be reminding them pre-match of what he did all those years ago,â Millen said. âBut the goal for the current players is to make their own history. They and I would want to be part of another successful âThen you become a hero yourself further down the line. Itâs good to remind them of the history the club has had, especially against Liverpool have suffered on recent visits to this corner of south London, not least last year when they shipped three goals in the last 11 minutes to Tony Pulisâs side in May to draw 3-3 and leave their title challenge forlorn. Palace, then under Neil Warnock, also triumphed 3-1 in November despite the visitors having taken an early lead. âComing back to places where youâve suffered can play on your mind,â said Millen. âItâs not the most luxurious dressing room when you come to Selhurst either. Ours have been done up now.
âWhether theyâre scarred from the last two games, who knows? But without a doubt itâs a different Liverpool team coming this time. Theyâve changed formation, theyâre full of confidence again, theyâre passing and moving and, whoever plays, itâs going to be a tough one for us. If we can get through this tie we might be one of the favourites left in the competition, but this game will be a huge test for us.â
Pardew has actually won twice as many FA Cup ties in six weeks at Palace â albeit only two â than he did in over four years as manager of Newcastle and, while he will be without his influential midfielders Mile Jedinak and James McArthur through injury, the Senegal left-back Pape Souaré is available. The £3.45m signing from Lille was finally granted a work permit this week and will be included in the squad, with Yannick Bolasie and Dwight Gayle â so influential in the sidesâ two meetings last year â expected to start.
Wilfried Zaha, capped twice by England, will also hope to feature as he continues to rebuild his career back at Palace after failing to make his mark with Manchester United. âThere were other clubs in for me in January but in my mind I wanted to come back to Palace,â said the winger, who had spent the first half of the campaign on loan at the club before making the move permanent on deadline day. âIt is definitely the club I want to be at. I am back home. Everything is local to me, my family, my friends. I just play football and go home with a smile on my face.
âStaying in the Premier League is the priority, definitely. Thatâs one of the biggest things for the club. We are a Premier League team so we want to stay there. But a decent Cup run would be the icing on the cake for us. We are playing quite well right now. We just have the confidence to play well against any team.â
