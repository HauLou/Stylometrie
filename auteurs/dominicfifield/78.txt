Pogba, who controversially moved to Turin from Manchester United three years ago, had been expected to leave Juve to enable the Italian club, who claimed a fourth successive Serie A title over the weekend and compete in the Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid on Tuesday, to rebuild an ageing squad. The 22-year-old is currently nursing a hamstring injury but hopes to return to action in time for the second leg of the tie against Real.
The reigning European champions were one of the clubs expected to target Pogba this summer, with Barcelona having already made known their long-term interest and both Manchester United and Chelsea monitoring the Frenchmanâs situation.
âAt the moment Pogba is one of the best young players in the world so itâs normal that many big clubs would set their sights on him,â Giuseppe Marotta, Juventusâs director general and sports department chief executive, told RadioUno. âBut we, too, are a big club and weâre not in the habit of selling our best players.
âLook back over our long history and Juve have sanctioned very few sales of big-name players. And at the moment the conditions are not right to put Pogba on the market.â
The player, who has 22 caps for France, is contracted at Juventus until 2019 with a price in excess of £75m having been mooted when he does decide the time is right to move on.
