Brendan Rodgers spied evidence that Liverpool are returning to the form which propelled them into last seasonâs title race after his team produced an âoutstandingâ performance to prevail at Bournemouth and secure a Capital One Cup semi-final against Chelsea in the new year.
Two goals from a resurgent Raheem Sterling, his first since September, helped deflate the Championship leaders, with âThat first half was as good as Iâve seen this season,â said Rodgers. âSlowly, weâre getting there. Players are adapting. Iâm always looking to find ways to be more creative, because weâve not been that this season, but tonight it was more like we produced last season. It was an outstanding performance.
âI was hopeful after [the 3-0 loss at] Old Trafford, even though the result wasnât ideal. Iâd seen moments in our game which were good, creating a lot of chances. We know we still have a long way to go, but the signs are there.
âThis was a tough game against a team who are top of the league, so for us to dominate as we did was very pleasing. Itâs taken a long time for us to find rhythm this season but the work rate has never stopped. It takes character and quality to get through at places like this, but that first goal was a wonderful example of patience, movement and creativity. We showed outstanding quality on the ball, we waited for the moment and then we seized the chance.â
Sterling got his first headed goal for the club, to suggest he is not being distracted by contract negotiations or, indeed, the fatigue that had nullified his impact in the autumn.
âHeâs a kid that, for some reason, seems to have been getting a lot of stick this season,â said Rodgers. âHis contract situation is nothing to do with him. His representatives are the ones working with the club. You can see heâs happy and enjoying his football.
âHe was unfortunate not to score at Old Trafford but was a real threat there. He plays in that role Alexis Sánchez enjoys for Arsenal, not as an out-and-out striker but where his speed and movement causes problems: his ability to turn and drop in, his threat on the counterattack. Heâs been the real catalyst for us this season.â
Sterlingâs goals were a welcome relief for Rodgers on the day it was revealed that his fellow forward, Daniel Sturridge, is to spend Christmas working with the medical staff of the Boston Red Sox baseball team in an attempt to resolve his longstanding injury problems.
The âTommy stopped because he thought the referee had blown,â said Howe, who had watched as Lazar Markovic scored in the confusion. âBut we have to use this defeat as a positive. We showed we can create chances against a very good team. But Liverpoolâs first-half performance was very high technically. You could see their players were world class.â
Chelsea, Liverpoolâs nemesis last season with that critical win at Anfield in April, await in the last four next month in a repeat of the 2005 League Cup final, which yielded José Mourinhoâs first trophy in English football.
âWeâll look forward to it,â said Rodgers. âItâll be a fantastic tie. The most important thing was getting through the game tonight. Itâs going to be a very difficult game for us [against Chelsea] but it didnât matter who we got. We needed to get there. But now itâs over two legs and weâll relish that opportunity.â
