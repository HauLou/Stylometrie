Charlie Austin will meet the Queens Park Rangers director of football, Les Ferdinand, after the international break to discuss his future, with the striker having suggested his aim is to remain in the Premier League.
Austin, who hopes to make his England debut against the Republic of Ireland on Sunday, scored 18 goals in his first top-flight campaign despite QPR finishing bottom to return to the Championship after a season-long stay. Austin has a year to run on his contract with the club seeking a fee of up to £15m before they will consider parting with the 25-year-old. Southampton hope to secure his services.
The player has acknowledged his best opportunity to prolong a career with England is to remain in the Premier League and will speak with Ferdinand and the manager, Chris Ramsey, on the national teamâs return from Slovenia, where they play a week on Sunday.
âI just want to concentrate on the next two weeks, enjoy the moment and what will be will be,â he said. âWho knows what the future will hold for me? I feel like Iâve worked hard enough this season for QPR to try to be a Premier League player but, at the moment, Iâve still got a year left at âSo the futureâs up to the club and my agent to sort out. Iâll sit down with my family and my agent. Iâll speak to Chris Ramsey and Les Ferdinand and tell them my thoughts, and theyâll tell me theirs. After these two weeks, Iâll sit down with the club but, for now, I just want to be fully focused on these next two weeks with England.â
âOn a personal level, if youâd said to me I would end up with 18 goals, I would have been delighted with that,â said Austin. âLuckily enough, my hard work paid off. But, unfortunately, as a team we underachieved and my goals couldnât help Queens Park Rangers in the league.â
