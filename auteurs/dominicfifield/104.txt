It was Laurent Blanc who brought up the need for âa minor miracleâ on the eve of Paris Saint-Germainâs PSG are without Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Marco Verratti and Serge Aurier through suspension, as well as the hamstrung Motta. Lucas Moura, who is not fully recovered from a groin injury, will only be on the bench while David Luiz, treated recently in Russia for his own hamstring issues, is unlikely to feature despite being a surprise and welcome inclusion in a 19-man party. PSGâs lavishly assembled squad boasts depth but, , they confront a team whose reputation on this stage is established. Barça have won 30 of their past 34 matches in all competitions and their players, as Blanc volunteered, are capable of âplaying PlayStation football against anyoneâ.
In the circumstances, the fact they have been beaten in Paris once already this season, the hosts winning 3-2 in the autumnâs group stage, would appear to count for little. Yet, beyond the managerâs occasionally painful realism, this is a club that believe their time has come.
The knockout round elimination of Chelsea has pepped conviction that PSG, quarter-finalists in each of the last two seasons only to be jettisoned on away goals, need not fear any opponents as their seasonâs pursuit of four trophies is maintained. They are top of Ligue 1, in next monthâs French Cup final against Ligue 2 Auxerre, and League Cup winners already. There are plenty of reasons to be bullish.
PSG are unbeaten in 33 home games in Europe going back to 2006. In Edinson Cavani they boast an industrious forward anxious to seize the opportunity afforded him by Ibrahimovicâs untimely absence. Javier Pastore, whose impact in Ligue 1 since arriving as the first major signing of the Qatari ownershipâs tenure had been so fitful, is enjoying the most consistently threatening form of his career, an Argentina international capable of âextraordinary things now he believes in himselfâ, according to Blanc. Blaise Matuidi is all tigerish aggression in midfield, with Adrien Rabiot a player of huge promise at his side, while Marquinhos is developing into a defender of class and quality alongside Thiago Silva.
Depleted they may be, but there is still faith in the collective born, significantly, of the resilience and stubborn refusal to wilt which was demonstrated at the Premier League leadersâ expense at Stamford Bridge last month. âKnocking Chelsea out gave us belief and proved we were progressing as a team and a club,â said Maxwell, another former Barça player now settled in Parisian ranks. âIt convinced us we were ready, and that we were close to the level required to win this competition. Weâre better placed this year than in the two previous quarter-finals, and have been playing with real intensity since January. We are ready.â
The left-back pointed to the damage that can be inflicted on Luis Enriqueâs visitors, extolling the qualities of a revamped forward line which will see Cavani flanked by Ezequiel Lavezzi and Pastore.
Blanc was more cagey and acknowledged the considerable threat posed by Barçaâs attacking options. He is attempting to strike the appropriate balance between the need to capitalise on home advantage and a desire to avoid conceding an away goal. âAny Barça are a team who can score from anywhere and against anyone in Europe,â he said. âSometimes you have to make sure you donât concede at home, perhaps more than scoring yourselves.â
His principal concern is Lionel Messi. âWhen he scores 40 goals, we say heâs out of form and heâs impossible to stop when he gets up a head of steam,â he said. âHeâs one of the best footballers ever, of any generation: a dribbler, a goalscorer, an exceptional passer. How do you stop him? Putting a player on him actually does him a favour because heâs never afraid to dribble at a marker, one on one. Put two or three on him, then â¦ heâs a problem you have to address collectively.â
The visitors, top of La Liga and in the quarter-finals for the eighth successive season, will unleash their celebrated front three with relish though Luis Enrique must determine whether to fling four across the back or retain a three with Dani Alves suspended. âThis PSG team have already shown theyâre a force in the last few seasons,â said the Barça coach. âTo have beaten Chelsea â¦ well, itâs clear they have qualities. They beat us [in September] without Ibrahimovic, and we beat them when Zlatan was back in the team. Theyâre a threat whether those players are available are not. This tie is open.â
