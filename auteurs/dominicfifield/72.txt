Alan Pardew has challenged Wilfried Zaha to maintain the progress that has been so marked this term having been granted regular Premier League football, as the England winger prepares to confront Zaha, Sir Alex Fergusonâs final signing as Unitedâs manager in January 2013 for a fee that might have risen to £15m, returned to Selhurst Park on loan last August before making that move permanent for nearer £6m on Februaryâs deadline day. The 22-year-old had played only four times for David Moyesâs team last season, spending the second half of the campaign on loan at Cardiff, but has established himself under Alan Pardew over recent months with some excellent displays.
The player himself has indicated a desire âto get one overâ his former club when United, beaten in their last three league games, visit south London on Saturday evening, with Pardew delighted by the progress Zaha has made under his stewardship.
âHis time at United was a period in his career when things didnât work out, and that happens for players, coaches and managers,â said Pardew. âWhat heâs done [here] is approach it all in the right way. Heâs been focused on the job.
âHeâs learned you have to do certain things defensively in the Premier League without taking away from your offensive ability. He never really had an opportunity to learn that at United because he just didnât play enough. Thatâs no fault of Man Unitedâs: itâs the standards they have. He perhaps wasnât quite ready. But he is a player we hope will grow here and will make an impact tomorrow. Iâm sure heâll be motivated to do that.â
Zaha, who joined the Palace academy at the age of 12, had initially described his move to Old Trafford as a âdreamâ though, with Ferguson departing the club that summer, he never had the opportunity to play under the manager who had bought him. Louis van Gaal spoke to him last summer and indicated he did not consider the player, capped twice by England, to be good enough to warrant a place in the first-team.
âThereâs nothing much to look back on, because I never really played,â said the winger. âI was just there not playing and not really doing anything, so all I can think about is now.
âThere is no point thinking about the past because nothing happened for me there. Itâs 50-50 really, in terms of proving a point. Theyâre like any other team who are going to be up for it, but at the same time I didnât get the chance to prove myself. So it would be nice to get one over them on Saturday.â
He has featured in 32 matches for Palace this season, scoring in the wins over Queens Park Rangers and Stoke, and offering Chelseaâs Branislav Ivanovic a severe test of his defensive abilities last Sunday.
Pardew, who confirmed the club will offer Brede Hangeland and Shola Ameobi new deals before the expiry of their contracts this summer, suggested Zaha remains a work in progress as he seeks to rebuild the playerâs confidence after the anti-climax of that spell at United. âHeâs a player who needs to be reinforced with confidence in him,â he said. âHe has tremendous talent in a one-on-one situation: thatâs what weâll try to exploit with his career. Heâs learning the other, defensive side of his game very well and quickly.
âWeâre really pleased with him. Heâs really exciting and our fans love him. To stay in the team he has to continue putting in the performances that he has. He has to add goals to his game â thatâs the next step for him. But quality in the final pass is something that comes with experience. Making the right decision at the right time â¦ he sometimes gets that wrong. All young players do. Even the greats, like Ryan Giggs, still didnât maximise those opportunities until they were a bit older. Thatâs what weâll try and gain from him.
âHe still gets despondent when something doesnât go well for him in the game. Thatâs a psychological issue for him that heâs trying to address. Heâll get it out of his system. The more success he has, the more heâll understand the game doesnât always revolve around Wilf. He wants it to, but sometimes it doesnât pan out like that. Both Wilf and Yannick [Bolasie] are still in the learning process of being at this level and, to be a regular at a big club, theyâd probably need more time here. I expect them to be with us again at the start of next season.â
