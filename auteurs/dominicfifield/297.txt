Neil Warnock will resist any attempt by The former Sheffield United and Queens Park Rangers manager is currently enjoying his fourth taste of the top flight having been reappointed at Selhurst Park in August as the successor to Tony Pulis. The veteran had been undertaking media work since leaving Leeds in April 2013, but has lost only one of five league games back with Palace and was included on the shortlist for manager of the month.
Yet Palace, who host Chelsea on Saturday, had made clear their desire to set in motion a clear succession when offering the 65-year-old a 24-month contract, and had explored the possibility of luring either Shaun Derry or Tony Popovic â currently managers at Notts County and Western Sydney Wanderers â back to the club to work initially as his assistant with an eye to taking over in the long term. Indeed, there were suggestions this week that the club might seek to move Warnock upstairs rather quicker than had initially been anticipated, though the manager suggested he had not been left with that impression in his own discussions with the board.
âI enjoy most aspects of this job really,â said Warnock. âBut the main thing I miss is the training ground, the banter during the week. I do enjoy talking to players, trying to get the best out of them., and then seeing them go through â¦ José [Mourinho] is always on about players going through brick walls for him. You want your players to do things on a match day and show how much they care, and itâs lovely when that happens.
âAbsolutely, Iâd miss that [if he undertook a director of football role]. I once said I wouldnât mind doing something like that, when I finished either at Leeds or QPR. I did think about it. But Iâm not sure Iâd want to do that now. I actually enjoyed doing my BT and TalkSport media work. I think, if youâre not a manager, you might as well enjoy life really. Iâm not sure Iâd want to do anything like that now.â
Warnock has made additions to his back-room staff with the appointment of Ronnie Jepson and Kevin Blackwell, but the aim of establishing a line of succession is on-going with the current manager occupied by more immediate issues. added: âI look at next week, thatâs all, about West Bromwich Albion and Sunderland, the next two games,â he said. âBut I couldnât even tell you who weâre playing in November. I know that sounds silly. Whether thatâs bad on my part I donât know. I just look at the next couple of games and probably take a little more notice about them. Looking too far ahead is a dangerous precedent in this game.â
Palace will confront the league leaders, and their nine-goal forward Diego Costa, without the injured centre-half Scott Dann, who damaged the medial ligaments in his knee in the recent loss at Hull City. Warnock is hopeful the player, such a key part of this team, could be available for the game at the Hawthorns in a weekâs time but he will choose between Adrian Mariappa, Brede Hangeland or Martin Kelly to fill in alongside Damien Delaney against Chelsea.
