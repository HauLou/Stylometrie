José Mourinho has suggested clubs, City were fined around £50m by Yet Mourinho has been critical of Uefaâs decision to impose fines on the three offenders, City, Paris Saint-Germain and Zenit St Petersburg, arguing the sanction does not act as a proper deterrent.
âEverybody knows there are fines and, if these fines exist, control exists,â said the Chelsea manager in an interview with Maisfutebol. âBut, anyway, are the fines fair? I donât think so. In my opinion the first thing to do would be to remove points and remove titles. If you have important capital which allows you to overcome financial fair play, if you win titles and then you are fined economically, you keep doing the same thing.
âThey will take from you one or two players from the Champions League list [shrugs]. Then, instead of 24, you go with 22. But if youâre stating that youâll start the next Champions League with six points fewer, or you wonât play in the next edition of the Champions League and will go into the Europa League instead, it is more serious.â
Chelsea travel to City on Sunday seeking to extend their lead over the champions to eight points, and with a reunion with their former stalwart âI donât think he has [harmed his relationship with Chelsea],â said Mourinho. âHe has not with me, thatâs for sure. I still believe that what this club proposed to him, to come back when he wants and to do what he wants â these were the words from Mr Abramovich â is not in any danger.
âThis is just a period of his career. We thought he was going to play for New York. He decided to play for City. I was not expecting him to play for City but it was just an option and he had that right to do that. His place in Chelseaâs history is untouchable. I think, in the future, nothing has been lost. He will be back one day, I think so.â
