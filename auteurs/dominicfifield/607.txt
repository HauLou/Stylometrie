The Football Association will seek to arrange prestigious friendlies for Wembley amid fears that the standard of opposition handed to Roy Hodgson was at Nice's Palais des Congrès Acropolisto witness his team being placed alongside The necessity to draw hefty crowds to Wembley, a £757m stadium on which the FA still owes £277m, according to the latest figures, is clear with 10-year debentures at the stadium up for renewal in 2017. The governing body, which is contracted to play England's home games at the national stadium, will explore ticket pricing in line with the competitive fixtures to be scheduled in the qualification campaign and seek to entice glamorous opposition â in line with those arranged to celebrate the body's 150th anniversary â for the four friendly windows per season with a view to securing sell-outs.
"We've got to balance this with how we make the friendlies attractive as well to the fans who come to every game," said Adrian Bevington, the managing director of Club England. "We've got to sit down with Roy and the commercial department. I'm confident we will still get good crowds at Wembley.
"We would look to get high-ranking opponents, good opposition. That doesn't mean we would never play someone outside the elite, or an away game, because there will be times the manager wants us to play an away game, but generally we want to populate the friendlies with attractive opposition, to make sure we get teams who are much higher seeded, as we have done recently with Germany and Brazil."
England did manage to attract a remarkable 84,654 fans for their 5-0 World Cup qualifying victory over San Marino in October 2012 but there is an acceptance that, in testing economic times, innovative ticketing will have to be explored. "We've got to price it to make it attractive for families and are very aware of the importance of pricing accordingly to fill the stadium," Bevington added.
"That's always been our priority since the stadium opened and it will remain the core objective of what we do. We want to get as many fans into Wembley and price it as competitively as possible, and we consider every game in that way to try and get the crowds we have done previously. We, as an organisation, have to make sure that whatever friendly matches we have are against good opposition in terms of a ranking position."
Hodgson did not betray any concerns that the general standard of opposition in Group E might stunt his younger players' development, but argued a successful qualification campaign would serve to attract crowds to the national stadium. "I'll have to leave the job of Wembley to someone else," he said. "I'd like to think with our performances and the way we play that we will do it, but I do understand the point. It might have to be a joint effort."
The Scotland manager, Gordon Strachan, conceded that "some groups you might call mundane" as Uefa seek to revamp the finals into a 24-team tournament, though his own side have arguably been handed the toughest section. They will confront Martin O'Neill's Wales must contend with the much-fancied Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Israel, Cyprus and Andorra, while
