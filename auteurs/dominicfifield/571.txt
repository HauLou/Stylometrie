Jos√© Mourinho is expected to learn on Wednesday whether he is to face further sanction from the Football Association after being sent to the stands in stoppage time of Saturday's Premier League defeat at Aston Villa.
The governing body is still scrutinising the referee's report and footage of the incident, sparked by Ramires's ugly challenge on Karim El Ahmadi and subsequent sending off. The challenge had prompted a mini pitch invasion from both dugouts, with Mourinho sent to the stands after returning to the pitch seeking to speak to the referee, Chris Foy.
That was the second occasion he has been sent from the technical area this season having suffered a similar fate in the victory over Cardiff City at Stamford Bridge in October.
The That notion was quickly dismissed by Professional Game Match Officials Limited, who make appointments for Premier League matches, and the FA ruled that Mourinho had not questioned the integrity of the referee and had, therefore, not left himself open to a misconduct charge. The Chelsea manager had suggested on Monday that, while Ramires's lunge had merited a red card, it had been prompted by frustration that had built up at the official's performance over the course of the game at Villa Park.
