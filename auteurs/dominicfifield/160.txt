José Mourinho fears English football is in danger of losing its credibility with âpeople all around the worldâ perplexed as to how Nemanja Matic will miss Sundayâs Capital One Cup final through suspension while Ashley Barnes will be available for Burnleyâs game against Swansea on Saturday.
The Chelsea manager, whose team attempt to win the first trophy of his second spell in charge against Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley, remains incensed to have lost the Serb for two games after the midfielder pushed Barnes to the turf following the forwardâs ill-timed tackle in last Saturdayâs draw at Stamford Bridge. Mourinho claimed the Football Associationâs decision not to sanction the Burnley player while Matic sits out a ban, albeit reduced from three games, will damage the English gameâs reputation around the world.
The Portuguese had initially been reluctant to reflect on the ramifications of last Saturdayâs draw, but felt compelled to comment when asked about the need for Sundayâs showpiece to pass without controversy. âI have worked in so many different countries and I know what the âThe dimension of the Premier League: not just the audiences and the millions of people who watch, but the feeling and envy they have for English football â¦ the respect and credibility.
âFor example, in a very important newspaper in my country, after the Burnley game the headline was: âWe thought this was only possible in Portugal, never in England,ââ Mourinho claimed. âThe depth of this message, you understand? This is something English football cannot lose. The credibility in which English football is held has taken a long time to build and will take a long time to lose.
âBut, step by step, people are affected. These words were not just in Portugal. They were everywhere. We must take care of our football. Iâm not English but I have worked here a long time and I have to believe it belongs to me.â
Asked to expand upon what he considered to be the âcredibilityâ of the game here, Mourinho said: âFor example, you lose credibility when a player like Matic is suspended, and another player [Barnes] can play this weekend. I donât think you can have any doubt that all around the world people open their mouths with surprise at how this can be possible.â
The club subsequently released a statement confirming they were âappalledâ at that decision and suggesting more must be done to protect players.
