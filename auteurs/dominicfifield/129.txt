The former England international, who hoisted his 13th major honour as a Chelsea player when the team claimed the Capital One Cup earlier this month, has made 661 appearances for the club since his debut in 1998. Terryâs career had appeared to be winding down over Rafael Benítezâs interim stewardship at the club in 2012-13, when niggling injuries had hampered his impact, but has been revived under Mourinho. He is an ever-present in the Premier League to date this term.
âThis new contract is not to say: âThank you very muchâ,â said the The league leaders have long since implemented a policy of offering players over 30 only 12-month extensions, with this now the second Terry has signed.
âIâm delighted to have signed an extension to my contract with Chelsea,â said the centre-half. âAfter adding another major trophy to my collection this month I hope myself, the players and manager can continue to bring success to our club. Playing for this great club makes me so proud. And as always I would like to thank the fans who have continually supported me.â
The emergence this season of Kurt Zouma as a centre-half of real potential has added to Chelseaâs options and, while another defender may be added to the ranks at the end of the season, Terryâs form had demanded that his stay at the club be prolonged. The 34-year-old is hoping to claim his fourth Premier League title this term, adding that to three League Cups, five FA Cups, a European Cup and the Europa League.
