knockout victory over USA, with millions of euros spent in bars across a country draped in tricolours and local celebrities jumping on the bandwagon. The former Olympic high jump champion, Tia Hellebaut, even baked a pie in national colours such is the excitement generated by a second ever World Cup quarter-final on this, the teamâs first appearance at the tournament in 12 years. The mood is already one of celebration. And yet, over in Brazil, the coach, Marc Wilmots, is anything but satisfied.
His squad had arrived back from Salvador at their base in Mogi das Cruzes at around 3am on Wednesday morning and, while the first-team rested that day, their reward for progress extended merely to a visit from their families limited to 20 minutes. Focus, it seems, is everything. âListen, Iâm not here to celebrate a place in the last eight,â said Wilmots when asked about the time limit. âIâm here to continue winning matches. I remember a physio once told me, when I was a player at Schalke and he was giving me a massage: âMarc, when you are in the quarters, you canât stop. You have to go on and reach the final.â That year we ended up winning the Uefa Cup. So I donât see why, with This squad, in time, has the capability to do exactly that but they have no reason to be fearful on Saturday. Belgiumâs exciting young team will run out at the Estádio Nacional convinced they can force passage beyond Argentina and into a first semi-final since 1986. There is good reason for optimism, even against one of the favourites to claim this trophy. Wilmots, nicknamed âWar Pigâ from his club career in Germany, has imbued the same industrious spirit and unswerving conviction in this squad which drove him on as a player who captained his country at the World Cup finals in South Korea and Japan. They, like The confrontation with USA may have dragged into extra time, but it still felt like a release. Wilmotsâ team unleashed 38 shots that night and were only denied a landslide victory by Tim Howardâs excellence and their own inaccuracy. If profligacy was a problem, their ability to utilise space and attack on the counter â they have scored three goals in Brazil on the break â should bode well against an Argentina side who will be expected to be expansive. There is pace in this team, from Eden Hazard to Kevin De Bruyne, Dries Mertens to Divock Origi. Romelu Lukaku was back to his bruising best in extra time. Adnan Januzaj may still be absent injured, but Kevin Mirallas is eagerly awaiting more opportunities to impress. This squad boasts a rare depth of quality.
They are sound of defence, too, though the concern is inevitably Lionel Messi, who will draw level with Diego Maradona as his countryâs sixth most capped player on his 91st appearance. Belgium remember Maradona all too well: there is that celebrated image of the little master, then aged 21, staring down six opponents in Barcelona back in 1982, a game Argentina actually lost; and there is the brace at the Estadio Azteca four years later which deflated the Red Devils in their semi-final. Messi, with four goals and a quartet of man of the match awards to his name in as many games, is the modern-day genius inspiring Argentina, and therefore the man to be feared.
Wilmots may ask Steven Defour, restored after a ban, to man-mark the Barcelona forward, though the Swiss learned in the last 16 that Messi can be stifled for 118 minutes but still provide the defining pass that casts opponents from the competition. At least Belgium have Thibaut Courtois, the Chelsea goalkeeper who is unbeaten in his 21 caps and has confronted Messi 10 times while with Atlético Madrid and, in the last seven of those fixtures, has kept him out. There is also the sheer power of their collective. âWe must stand as a team against him,â said Jan Vertonghen. âIf he gets past one of us, there has to be a second man and then a third to stand up against him. We know we are a difficult team to play against: we can play different systems and we have a lot of good players on the bench, people who can change a game. It is exceptional to have so many different qualities in a squad. We are certainly not scared about Saturday.â
Thomas Vermaelenâs recovery from injury has added to Belgiumâs defensive options even if Daniel Van Buyten, outstanding at centre-half even at 36 and a team-mate of Wilmotsâ in 2002, will not surrender his starting place. The veteran has received texts of praise and support from his club manager, Pep Guardiola, this week. âWe canât concentrate just on Messi, even if he is the best player on the planet, because they have Ángel di María who is also on form,â said Van Buyten. âWeâll have to be solid and to believe, because hard work is rewarded.â
So, too, is flair. Where life was so cramped against Algeria, Russia and South Korea in the group, now there may be space for the Belgians to exploit against an Argentina side whose defence has been shaky and will be further disrupted by a suspension to Marcos Rojo. âThe pressure is on them because, so far, theyâve only really shown a few flashes of individual brilliance to get this far,â said Mirallas. âItâs been enough to get them to the last eight, but I think theyâll want to show a different Argentina against us. Yes, we struggled to break teams down in the group. But there was more space against the United States, and there will be more still against Argentina. That might allow players like me to play and hurt them. And, hey, we have Eden. You might not compare him yet to a Messi or a Cristiano Ronaldo, but he is still something very special.â
Hazard has offered only flashes to date but this could be the Chelsea forwardâs stage, a chance to make a statement with Messi in direct opposition. Their duel is mouth-watering, but so is this quarter-final. Belgium, as a nation, will down tools back home to be glued to coverage from Brasília. If Wilmots has his way they will have to do so again next Wednesday with their adventure prolonged.
