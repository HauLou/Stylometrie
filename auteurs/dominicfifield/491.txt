Few managers in world football can challenge Ancelottiâs experience. There is intrigue at the emergence of Diego Simeone, and admiration for the disciplined and imposing Atlético Madrid side the Argentinian oversees, but the Italian who sends The last was Aprilâs Copa del Rey, a victory achieved against Barcelona to ensure that, regardless of how matters pan out in Lisbon, this will not be a trophy-less first season at Real. In that glittering context it is strange, then, to consider that, should Atlético deny Real their 10th European Cup, Ancelottiâs tenure might be jeopardised. The volatile club president, Florentino Pérez, has apparently been chuntering again behind the scenes, his dissatisfaction with football managers in general â other than possibly José Mourinho, whose confrontational attitude he rather admired â having reared once more with a third-place finish in La Liga raising his heckles. Delivering Pérez has actually been questioning Ancelotti for some time, private disquiet which has inevitably found its way back to the manager. The 54-year-old is worldly wise when it comes to major footballing institutions but, even if he remains publicly unruffled, it is fair to say he has been baffled by elements of Real life. So unpredictable is the president that, should the team triumph in Portugal, it is far from implausible that Pérez emerges to praise the Italian to the rafters. Yet it was notable that, in the wake of the Copa del Rey success â secured courtesy of a stunning winner from Gareth Bale, the presidentâs marquee signing â he had heaped plaudits on Realâs match-winners, even Barçaâs players and fans, without once mentioning Ancelotti.
The manager was asked about the uncertainty at the clubâs media day this week. âIâm not thinking of my future,â he replied with a smile that felt familiar from his final year at Chelsea. âIt doesnât depend on what happens in the final. Iâm happy to stay with Real Madrid, whether we win Yet he, more than anyone, will know any personal desire to remain at the Bernabéu is essentially irrelevant. His future at the club will be determined by the whims of one notoriously impatient powerbroker. Potential suitors, whether back home in Italy or even north London, will be watching events with interest.
Even putting his curriculum vitae aside, the fact Ancelotti finds himself under pressure is merely a reminder of how ludicrous life at elite clubs can be. This is a manager who had been aggressively pursued by Pérez last summer â the third time the Spaniard had sought out his services â and, once his head had been turned, was eventually prised from Paris Saint-Germain on a three-year contract. He arrived at a club intent on adding Bale to their ranks, at world record cost, and was charged with integrating the latest His achievements at the Bernabéu could be measured in terms of results alone. If so, silverware and a first European Cup final for 12 years might normally constitute a more than satisfactory return. Yet arguably more impressive has been his diplomacy, his massaging of egos and coaxing of form and consistency from big-name players. He has succeeded in utilising Ronaldo and Bale in the same team, arguably eking out the best football of the Portugueseâs career en route. Luka Modric has been phenomenal. Angel di María, a player who endured abuse from the stands earlier in the season, is re-invented and revived in a tweaked role. They have stepped up as a result of the managerâs input.
He had instigated the same response at Chelsea back in 2009-10, a season that yielded the clubâs first league and FA Cup double with the Italian rejuvenating a generation of winners who had hinted at staleness prior to his arrival even if sustaining such progress proved more problematic thereafter. âIf you pick two or three of the best coaches in the world, Carlo has to be one,â said Clement.
âHeâs very humble, and thatâs one of his great qualities. The players respect that. There is no ego. He sees himself on the same level and that opens up communication, and I think thatâs been really positive with this squad. It depends on the personality. Some continue to have an ego and that is important to them.â
The problem, ultimately, is the most significant ego occupies the boardroom. Ancelotti has always been fairly phlegmatic. He had already worked for Silvio Berlusconi at Milan and Roman Abramovich at Chelsea before encountering Pérez, and knew what he was joining last summer. He was never going to summon a more confrontational side to engage his president, as Mourinho had over three years, and experience tells him how these stories tend to play out.
âSometimes you are sacked and canât finish the job you start,â he had said back in February 2012 when interviewed by the Guardian, reflecting on his sacking at Chelsea. âBut, in Italy, we say if one door closes you can find a bigger door.â
If his team fail to overcome Atlético and the knee-jerk reaction does prompt the axe, he would depart with another handsome pay-off and his reputation unaffected. The queue of clubs interested in securing his services will be lengthy and glamorous. Some will surely offer him Champions League football. Tottenham Hotspur would offer the Europa League. Others, such as Milan, might seek his help in instigating a renaissance. His is in a no-lose situation.
Yet, for now, he will concentrate on the opportunity that lies ahead to make history and all such talk redundant. Ancelottiâs buzzword this term has become
