José Mourinho has offered Ruben Loftus-Cheek a timely reminder of what is expected of him as a Chelsea first-team player by branding the teenagerâs display in the friendly win over Sydney FC as unacceptable.
Loftus-Cheek, who was a surprise inclusion by Gareth Southgate in the England squad for the summerâs Under-21s European Championship, had impressed since being promoted to the senior set-up on a permanent basis in January. The academy graduate, who joined 
Yet Mourinho claimed his relationship with the 19-year-old had taken âone step backâ as a result of a lacklustre display in front of a crowd of 83,598 at the ANZ stadium on Tuesday. Loftus-Cheek had been replaced by Jeremie Boga in the starting line-up shortly before the kick-off but was introduced for Diego Costa just before the interval. After only 27 minutes on the pitch, he was substituted for Jordan Houghton with his manager distinctly unimpressed with the midfielderâs performance.
âRuben was saying he had a pain in his back but what I was feeling was that he only had this pain when Sydney had the ball,â said Mourinho, whose side won 1-0 courtesy of Loïc Rémy. âWhen Chelsea had the ball he was playing very well but when Sydney had the ball I think he was more impressed by watching [John] Mikel Obi and [Nemanja] Matic work, instead of him working himself. So, with Ruben, itâs one step back in terms of my relationship with him. If he doesnât know what it means to play for me and Chelsea, itâs one step back.
âI was happy with the performance of my senior players. because it has been a long season, in fact, a very long season. In one week they have to play important matches with their national teams. But they came to Thailand and Australia and respected the fans and opponents, and you could see some tired performances. The senior players, like Branislav Ivanovic, John Terry, John Obi Mikel and Eden Hazard, tried to play football, and they did.â
Mourinho added: âRuben has to learn that, at 19, you have to run three times as much as the other guys and you have to play to your limits. You donât have to play like a superstar with the ball at your feet because this is not the Under-18s. That competition is too easy for him. Heâs too good for it, but I donât accept that a player â¦ when we donât have the ball, doesnât press, doesnât have intensity and is waiting for other people to recover the ball. I donât accept that of superstars, so why should I accept it in a 19-year-old kid? He has to learn what it takes to play for us.â
Costa was named the man of the match despite his withdrawal, with Mourinho dismissive of mischievous suggestions, emanating from Madrid, that the striker is unhappy after only a year in English football. âHeâs the guy responsible for everything good we have in the dressing room,â he said. âHeâs so happy, heâs so funny, heâs enjoying every minute. Heâs the happiest guy in the dressing room so, if this is unhappiness, Iâm happy with that.â
Costa, who scored his 20th Premier League goal of the season in the final-day victory over Sunderland despite a succession of hamstring injuries, admitted there have been issues adapting to life in England but the Brazil-born forward is committed to the club and intent on making his mark again next season.
âItâs always a bit more difficult in the first season for adaptation but I have no reason to leave this place,âCosta said. âI love it, the fans love me, and I want to stay. Itâs really good to come in the first season and win two things [the league title and the Capital One Cup]. Next year Iâll be ready to come back and, hopefully, win a couple more trophies.â
