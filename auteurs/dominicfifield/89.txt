They had appealed for supporters to stay off the pristine playing surface at full-time, though that was always likely to prove wishful thinking. A freakish combination of results could technically still deny a club which has flirted with extinction in the recent past but, in reality, That pitch invasion was an outpouring of sheer jubilation, the home squad retreating to the tunnel to receive the congratulations of their hugely impressive, young manager, Eddie Howe, and celebrate raucously in the dressing room before emerging through the haze of Champagne to be presented effectively as top flight players.
Among their number were some who had risen through the divisions as this club was reborn. The substitute, Brett Pitman, had even played against Grimsby in 2009 when Howeâs side had retained their Football League status. Those were fraught days. This, in contrast, was the greatest in this clubâs history.

The Football Leagueâs manager of the decade addressed the crowd over the Tannoy, praising âan incredible group of playersâ but also the supporters who, at one stage, were conducting bucket appeals for funds to keep this club afloat.
âA lot of people put the work in to turn this round, not least the supporters putting their hands in their pockets to ensure the club survived,â he said. âI remember when I was a youth-team player, fans putting money in buckets at the Winter Gardens. To be in this position... it doesnât seem real. The loyal supporters who stayed with us need to savour this moment. Itâs been a monumental effort by all the players, the management team, everyone.â
It was celebrated together, the throng united even if the owner, Maxim Demin, politely declined an invitation to speak to the crowd. Hogging the limelight is apparently not the Russian petrochemical billionaireâs style, though his investment â in the infrastructure and playing squad â has played its part. This team have drawn the focus instead this term, with the clubâs transformation almost inconceivable. It is only seven years since Bournemouth began a League Two campaign with minus 17 points, Howe inheriting a side apparently destined for non-league.
Even Howe may shudder at the prospect when reality sinks in at some stage this week but, for now, it is best to remain giddy. This was an appropriate way in which to secure that promotion â notwithstanding the improbable mathematics of defeat at the Valley on Saturday and a 20-goal swing in third-placed Middlesbroughâs favour â with an attacking performance bursting with all the vim and vigour that has propelled them all season. There is quality in this team, and there will be further investment in the summer. They will stretch plenty of opponents next year.
It was a finish to lance the tension. Pugh is a veteran of five years at this club and Feeney, the man he had so bamboozled, had actually scored Bournemouthâs first goal in that 2-1 victory over Grimsby six years ago. Wanderers were broken, the din driving the home side on with the slippery pace and movement of their front line irrepressible. Wilson, the record signing from Coventry last summer and such a menacing presence all year, duly sprinted clear a minute before the break and pulled back for Yann Kermorgant whose lay-off was dispatched gloriously on the half-volley by Ritchie.
They would not be threatened thereafter. Harry Arter, bought for £4,000 from Woking and a player who had been losing 5-0 in front of 447 people at Bath City under six years ago, was a bustling presence in midfield alongside Andrew Surman, the back-line resolute, and a fluent and pacy forward combination unnerving Bolton. Dorian Dervite was dismissed for pulling down Wilson in the box and, although Kermorgant blazed his sideâs 16th league penalty of the term over the bar, there would be further reward before the end.
Another slick move saw Surman centre for Wilson to control, spin and dispatch at pace in the 78th minute to leave the majority in the arena bellowing: âWe are Premier Leagueâ into the night sky and mustering joyfully on the touchline. They will travel to Charlton intent upon claiming the title. âBournemouth celebrating like theyâve completely ruled out a 19-0 defeat at The Valley on Saturday,â tweeted the south London club. âWeâll see...â They would do well to catch a glimpse while they can. Howeâs side are not long for this level.
