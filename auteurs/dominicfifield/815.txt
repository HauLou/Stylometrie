Demba Ba has admitted he was eager to join Arsenal on loan this month in search of first team football, a move that broke down on transfer deadline day with The forward, who joined from Newcastle for £7m in January, has only featured once under José Mourinho and effectively slipped further down the pecking order in south-west London following the arrival of Samuel Eto'o from Anzhi Makhachkala. Eto'o's addition left Chelsea with four strikers from whom to choose and the club had been willing to sanction Ba's departure to either of his former clubs, Newcastle or West Ham, on a season-long loan, only for the 28-year-old to make clear Arsenal was his destination of choice.
When that move was blocked, Chelsea loaned Romelu Lukaku to Everton within minutes of the deadline to leave Ba competing with Eto'o and Fernando Torres for a striking berth.

Ba, so prolific over the first half of last season at Newcastle, scored only two Premier League goals for Chelsea after his move south and has conceded they have yet to benefit from his best form. "I'd be lying if I said 'yes' [I am satisfied with how I've performed], but I'd be lying if I said 'no' as well," added the forward, who has been included in the club's 23-man "Taking it from that point of view, not looking at any causes outside myself â¦ If I'd performed really well I'd have played every game. If I didn't play every game, it's probably because I didn't play well every match. But it means a lot to me now to have a chance of playing in the Champions League here. From the beginning of my career, I always wanted to play Champions League and, against FC
