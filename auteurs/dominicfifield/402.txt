The Rodríguez will take charge of the first âI hope the referee tomorrow, Mr Rodríguez from Mexico, will clamp down on the kind of things we saw last Friday. That physical energy in the match against Colombia went beyond the limits one would expect from a game in Europe. When I saw that match â¦ well, in Europe, 22 players wouldnât have ended that match on the pitch.
âThere were brutal fouls, people blocking opponents off however they could. It was really exaggerated. Thatâs what we saw on the pitch, so I hope these really brutal and crude fouls are stopped or we wonât see offensive players like Neymar or [Mario] Götze, [Mesut] Özil or [Lionel] Messi on the pitch and weâll just see players who go out there set to destroy. This is a World Cup thatâs full of dynamism and physical force but Iâve seen matches where that has gone over the limit.
âColombia against Brazil was a real fight with numerous fouls from both sides: not just the one foul against Neymar but many others as well. You saw how many fouls there were from behind which were really dangerous for the players: slide tackles from behind and from the side. You have to protect the players when youâre a referee. Thatâs something thatâs important for everyone working in football. You have to protect the attackers. They have been roughed up in a very bad way. I donât think it was a good thing that we saw there.â
Löwâs opposite number, Luiz Felipe Scolari, believes Brazil have recovered from the shock of losing their stellar performer and that they possess the quality to overcome Germany and progress to the final. The Brazil squad have spoken collectively to their sports psychologist, Regina Brandao, who was drafted in by Scolari in the wake of the nerve-shredding penalty shootout success over Chile in the last 16.
âNeymar has left us and has left a lot of himself with us, and heâs taken a lot of us with him,â said Scolari. âWeâve left behind that phase of being sad. Weâve accepted he wonât be with us any more. After we accepted that, the way he spoke to the players made the squad understand that he had done his share. Now itâs up to us to do our share: myself, the other players and all the Brazilian people. Weâll be playing this match not just for ourselves but for our country, for everything weâve ever dreamed of but also for Neymar and everything heâs done for us. Within our group weâve accepted that and weâre focused.â
Brazil will also be without their captain, the centre-half Thiago Silva, after Fifa confirmed there was âno legal basisâ to rescind his yellow card for unsporting behaviour during Fridayâs win. Silva had appeared to run deliberately in front of the opposing goalkeeper, David Ospina, as Ospina attempted to kick downfield and was duly cautioned for the second time in the tournament, prompting the one-game ban. Likewise Fifa will not pursue action against Zúñiga for the knee in Neymarâs back which effectively left a nation in mourning, as Carbello had apparently witnessed the incident and did not deem it worthy even of a caution.
âThat was a cowardâs tackle,â Silva said. âIâm a defender and I know that kind of challenge is not normal. You canât get the ball from someone by putting your knee into a playerâs back. But Neymar has already done what he had to do. Now itâs up to the other 22 to go out there and do everything for victory. Itâs made the group more united.â
His centre-half partner, David Luiz, will lead the team in his absence, with Bayern Munichâs Dante expected to deputise in the centre. Scolari may draft Luiz Gustavo into a three-man midfield, or recall Chelseaâs Willian on the right with Neymar not expected to attend the game as he continues his rehabilitation in São Paulo.
