The Queens Park Rangers chairman, The west London club are expected to promote their interim manager, Chris Ramsey, to the position on a permanent basis, potentially before Sundayâs final game at Leicester City, with a summer of rebuilding ahead. There is also the threat of a significant fine to be imposed by the Football League if they are found guilty of breaking rules over financial fair play during their campaign in the second tier in 2013-14, with legal proceedings ongoing to challenge those regulations. QPR are confident they will emerge from those discussions having avoided the £58m penalty that could technically apply, allowing them some leeway in the transfer market given the £25m parachute payment they will receive.
âWeâve always been chasing and desperate to get back up, but this time we will just stick to our guns and get players who have longer-term vision,â said Fernandes, who appointed Les Ferdinand as director of football in February to oversee a more long-term strategy. âWeâll see how it goes from there. Weâre feeling good, actually. Itâs strange. We feel like after four years we are finally in the groove.
âLast time we went down I was a lot more tense about it. I was worried about a lot of things. And yet we still got through it, we got back up. This time we go down in a much stronger position, with a better structure in place and better solutions to pursue with what we want to do in the long term.â
The most obvious lesson QPR appear to have learned is to insert relegation clauses into long-term contracts offered to their players since the teamâs demotion in 2013 â the clubâs annual wage bill in the second tier was £75.3m, almost double their turnover, hence the potential FFP fine â with those pay cuts now due to take effect from 1 July on the vast majority retained by the club.
âApart from the legacy players â and most of their contracts have finished â every player has relegation clauses,â said Fernandes. âWeâre wiser every time. We are in a much better position. The doom and gloom that everyone has been predicting is not that great [within the club].â
Bobby Zamora, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Rio Ferdinand, Richard Dunne, Karl Henry, Brian Murphy, Joey Barton, Clint Hill and Alejandro Faurlín are out of contract this summer. Hill may be offered a role on the coaching staff, and players such as Dunne and Barton may want new deals.
Faurlín is recovering from a long-term knee injury, and a new two-year deal has been agreed with the young full-back Darnell Furlong. Regardless, the summer will require the building of a new squad with the club likely to be receptive to offers for Adel Taarabt, Armand Traoré, Samba Diakité, Sandro â who has run into visa problems lately â and Nedum Onuoha.
Asked about the financial fair play situation, Fernandes confirmed: âIâve always been very confident that a positive resolution will come out of the FFP case that is fair to everyone. Iâd rather not comment any further.â Discussions between lawyers working on behalf of QPR and the Football League remain ongoing.
