He is expected to be on the bench for Saturday's return fixture against the same opponentsT.
here have been suggestions that Cole's former Arsenal team-mate, Thierry Henry, has attempted to persuade him to join him at "I like the player, I trust the player, I want him to stay," said Mourinho. "The club is happy with that, so we don't have a problem but [his decision] is another story that I cannot control. It's another part of the story that doesn't depend on us. Yes, he has [a future here] but maybe Thierry has a better proposal in New York."
Cole's star has fallen this season, with César Azpilicueta, a natural right-back, having excelled since swapping to the opposite flank. "That is the only reason Ashley is not playing," added Mourinho, who will fight for John Terry also to be offered a new one-year deal at the club. "Because Azpilicueta is playing fantastically well, not because Ashley Cole has been playing poorly. When César did not play, Ashley came in against Liverpool, Southampton and Hull and played very well. But, in my opinion, Azpilicueta is playing fantastically."
