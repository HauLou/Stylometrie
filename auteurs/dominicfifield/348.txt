The sports psychiatrist Steve Peters is to speak to Roy Hodgsonâs Peters, who has worked extensively with Liverpool over recent years, has accepted an invitation to continue his role in the England set-up, having been part of the backroom staff for the tournament in Brazil. He spoke to a number of players, including the new captain Wayne Rooney, while in Rio de Janeiro, after the squad were granted an open invitation to consult him over the course of the finals.
Peters is due at the national teamâs training centre in Burton-upon-Trent on Friday and plans to speak to members of Hodgsonâs squad either collectively, or with players on an individual basis, over the next few days. His objective will be to help the group move on from the summer travails in Brazil.
The Football Association do not expect him to travel to Switzerland for Mondayâs opening Euro 2016 qualifier in Basel.
