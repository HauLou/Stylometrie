Arsenal have lodged a complaint with Uefa after a bottle was flung at Arsène Wenger as he left the field at the end of a tempestuous first-leg draw against Aaron Ramsey will miss that game having been sent off for two second-half yellow cards, for soft fouls on Necip Uysal and Oguzhan Ozyakup. Wenger was bemused about how Demba Ba escaped sanction for a tackle on Mikel Arteta that left the Spaniard limping out of the game. The captain is now doubtful for Saturdayâs trip to Everton and While the bottle flung at Wenger â it missed â drew the post-match focus, it was Milorad Mazicâs display which provoked criticism. âNeither the first nor the second yellow card was deserved [for Ramsey],â said the Arsenal manager.
âWhen you see some of the fouls made tonight and we go home with Ramsey red-carded, itâs a bit unbelievable. The challenge on Arteta was very bad but the referee was on the pitch and didnât see anything of it. Itâs very difficult to understand but, in the second half, the performance of the referee was very bad.
âWe had Ramseyâs second card â¦ it was wrong and it was a huge decision. I felt just a lot was wrong in the second half but, overall, perhaps it was a difficult game maybe to referee as well. Everybody did fight for every ball. Maybe it was not easy for the referee as well.â
The former Italy World Cup official, Pierluigi Collina, had urged Uefaâs referees last week to clamp down on petty fouls and here was clear evidence that his words had been heeded, albeit at Ramseyâs expense. Yet Mazic, who was criticised for his display in Portugalâs defeat by Germany at the World Cup, struggled to maintain control in the second half as tempers became increasingly frayed.
The home manager, Slaven Bilic, was sent to the stands after complaining once too often at a decision, incensed that his team had not been allowed to play on after Mathieu Flamini had been left winded by a loose pass in the dying seconds.
âIt was a big game for us, right, and I just wasnât happy with some of the decisions,â said the former Croatia manager. âHe just showed me the way [off]. After the game I apologised to him and to Mr Wenger. I made a mistake. Maybe I overreacted in that situation when he stopped the game when the ball hit Flamini in the stomach and we were in a good position, two against one... But nothing serious happened in that moment or after the game.
âItâs not my call (if Uefa impose sanctions ahead of the second leg). But Iâm not used to this kind of situation. I had 60 or 70 games in charge of Croatia, but I think this is only the second time Iâve been asked out of the dug-out. I donât know the rules... but I see no reason for me not to be in the dug-out in London, really.â
Of the bottle incident on the final whistle, Wenger said: âAs I left the pitch a bottle or something was thrown at me. I reported the incident to Uefa.â
