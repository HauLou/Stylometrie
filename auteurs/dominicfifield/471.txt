So the forwardâs inclusion in the lineup against Ecuador in sultry Miami was, principally, an exercise in restoring upbeat rhythm to a player whose domestic campaign had been curtailed prematurely by a groin injury. Over a month had passed between a double against Norwich in April and his rather fitful display behind Daniel Sturridge against Peru last Friday. He was the only player retained in the starting XI from that Wembley send-off. âWe think heâs recovering his match fitness,â Hodgson had indicated in the buildup. Game time, in 75% humidity at kick-off, would be beneficial. But out left? Pinned to the flank in a role that had previously forced him to go on record in declaring dissatisfaction? âYes, itâs a position he could fill in Brazil,â added the manager.
In truth, Rooney rarely hugged the touchline here. His instinct is ever to meander into central zones, particularly when a move is developing wide right or even if he feels too isolated and peripheral. His club-mate Antonio Valencia and Juan Carlos Paredes patrolled Ecuadorâs right wing but, when England were actually persuasive attackers here, boasting encouraging fluidity to their forward play â albeit undermined by indecision at the back with all the inexperience on show â and should have secured swifter rewards before Rooney finally found an outlet to discharge pent up frustration. The half-hour was approaching, Hodgsonâs side in arrears to Enner Valenciaâs opener, when the slippery Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain clipped over a centre from the right which Rickie Lambert appeared to collect with an arm before back-heeling against the post from close-range. The Liverpool striker would have converted from the rebound had Rooney not reacted quicker to poke home. His punch of the air and bellowed exclamation in celebration of a 39th international goal felt like a release.
This was heartening. Rooney played with freedom, gliding into enemy territory and carrying a threat. His role on the left was actually an invitation to wreak havoc where he chose. René Meulensteen, who had coached the striker at United, had suggested before kick-off that it might actually suit the forward and his side with the England will not enjoy such large swathes of possession on 14 June and the calibre of player seeking to close Rooney down will be a notch up from Reinaldo Ruedaâs team but this offered Hodgson food for thought. Certainly, if his No10 can operate from wide, there are others who will not be overawed to occupy the nominal central berth. Barkley will probably only enjoy cameos in Brazil but he seems unfazed, the only criticism is the youngsterâs eagerness to try the daring which, inevitably, leads to the ball being surrendered on occasion. His run away from Guagua and Frickson Erazo to set up Lambert for Englandâs second was bold and brilliant.
Yet, if the 20-year-old is deemed too risky an inclusion in the opening fixture, Rooney could dove-tail effectively with Adam Lallana â perhaps more so than with Danny Welbeck â particularly with a more conventional winger on the opposite flank. Oxlade-Chamberlain staked his claim impressively but he suffered suspected knee ligament damage and faces a scan on Thursday which will determine whether the forward will be fit for the World Cup.
Then, of course, there is Raheem Sterling, who so illuminated Liverpool over the run-in to theâs Premier League campaign and whose pace could stretch tiring opponents. He replaced the teamâs No10 with 26 minutes to play here demonstrating Hodgson has options. Sterlingâs appearance lasted just 14 minutes, however, when the 19-year-old was sent off following a naive slide-through on Antonio Valencia, with the Ecuadorian also dismissed for grabbing the youngster by the throat in retaliation. The only certainty is that Rooney will remain key.
