The potentially damaging ramifications of Chelsea's furious defeat to Sunderland have become clearer after the Football Association issued charges against three members of the London club's squad, including the manager, José Mourinho.
The Brazil midfielder Ramires may have played his last domestic game of the season after the FA deemed his swing at Sebastian Larsson three minutes before the interval, which went unspotted by the referee Mike Dean, to be violent conduct. The offence was caught on video and was therefore scrutinised by a three-man panel of former elite referees, with their assessment unanimous that a misdemeanour had taken place.
Ramires has until 6pm on Thursday to respond to the charge but, if that is rejected, will serve a four-game ban having already been sent off this term in the league, against Aston Villa in mid-March. He was also dismissed in the Uefa SuperCup against Bayern Munich back in August, though that was in European competition.
The assistant manager, Rui Faria, has been charged with two counts of misconduct following his livid reaction to the award of Sunderland's late and decisive penalty after César Azpilicueta was penalised for bringing down Jozy Altidore. It is alleged the Portuguese used abusive and/or insulting words towards the fourth official, Philip Dowd.
It also alleged that Faria's behaviour following the match referee's request that he leave the technical area amounted to improper conduct. A statement from the governing body confirmed: "The FA has designated this as a non-standard case due to the aggressive and/or threatening and/or serious nature of the reported behaviour. Faria has until 6pm on Monday 28 April to respond to the charge."
Mourinho is still in the process of appealing against an £8,000 fine after being sent to the stands for re-entering the playing surface at Villa â his second such offence of the season following a dismissal against Cardiff last autumn â but has now been charged with misconduct following his post-match comments at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. The "It is alleged that Mourinho's comments constitute improper conduct, in that they call into question the integrity of the referee and/or the integrity of Mr Mike Riley, General Manager of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited, and/or the comments bring the game into disrepute," continued the FA statement.
"I want to congratulate again Mike Dean," Mourinho had said. "I think his performance was unbelievable and I think when referees have unbelievable performances, I think it's fair that as managers we give them praise. So, fantastic performance. He came here with one objective. To make a fantastic performance. And he did that. And congratulations also to Mike Riley, the referees' boss. What they are doing through the whole season is fantastic, especially in the last couple of months, and in teams involved in the title race. Absolutely fantastic. I also congratulate Mr Riley." Mourinho has until 6pm on Monday 28 April to respond to the charge.
Chelsea are considering their response to the three charges.
