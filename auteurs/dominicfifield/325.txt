The champions are already five points adrift and playing catch-up, with David Silva claiming they must ânot let the gap become biggerâ, an indication perhaps that even City have been surprised at how rapidly âAre we better than last season? We believe so. Do we have more potential than before? I believe so but we still have lots of work to do. In this kind of competition, with the quality of opposition we are up against and the number of teams fighting for the same objectives, itâs going to be very hard. Iâm not saying we have problems. Just that we have big space to improve. Lots of the players are young, with big potential and lots to learn tactically. Then again, I donât think Iâve ever been completely happy with any of my teams over the years.â
A confrontation with City at the Etihad Stadium will offer a better indication of Chelseaâs progress. Last Februaryâs success there â back when Manuel Pellegriniâs side boasted a perfect home record â had arguably constituted Mourinhoâs greatest domestic victory as Chelseaâs manager. The visitors struck upon that ideal blend of resilience at one end and expansive ambition in possession at the other, when everyone had anticipated Mourinho resorting to the â19th century footballâ he had so bemoaned when stifled by West Ham five days earlier.
Branislav Ivanovic scored the only goal but Chelsea had other opportunities and, even with a slender scoreline, the win felt convincing. Mourinho has spent time this week studying aspects of that success, as well as the 2-0 FA Cup defeat at the same venue 12 days later, as he seeks to strike the balance that this team still craves.
The management team have not been hoodwinked by the goal glut. There is dissatisfaction at the six conceded already in the league â the last time they shipped that many in their first four games was under Claudio Ranieri in the wake of Abramovichâs takeover â and the manner in which Leicester City frustrated, Schalke recovered in the Champions League and Swansea even dominated for long periods.
Some of the stubbornness of old has been watered down by attacking intent. Ivanovic is often camped up-field in enemy territory and better teams â the champions, perhaps â might exploit the space at his back. John Terry and Gary Cahill have been left exposed at times while still attuning themselves to the foibles of a new goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois. The Belgian, too, is adjusting to new surroundings. If the attack has clicked, this teamâs defensive approach still requires fine-tuning.
It will take time for solidity to be reimposed, whether at the back or in central midfield, where even Nemanja Matic is still relatively new to the scene. The process is continuing, a matter of training drills and game time to develop familiarity.
For now, this team play to their strengths with everything geared towards liberating Fàbregas in midfield and tapping into Costaâs strength, presence and bite up front. The Brazilâborn forward is hardly a revelation. Chelsea had identified him 18 months ago and monitored his remarkable progress at Atlético Madrid last term before prising him away, efficiently and shrewdly, even, at £32m. He already feels integral, which makes the task of managing his recent hamstring injuries key.
The Spain international ideally needs a fortnight off but the schedule will not allow that. Instead the 25-year-old was on the bench against Schalke and will sit out Wednesdayâs visit of Bolton Wanderers in the Capital One Cup. His left hamstring remains fragile but, when asked if the striker was too important to rest for a game of this magnitude, Mourinho offered a simple: âYes, he is.â Is his inclusion risky? âYes, but itâs a decision we have to take: me, him, [the medical director Paco] Biosca. The player is amazing, his attitude is amazing.
âClearly, we have to try and protect him until he gets completely fit. What we can do to improve the situation, we have to do if heâs not playing. He needs work, not just from the medical department but also on the pitch and in the gym.â The forward is still playing a full part in training, even if Wednesdayâs awkward conversation proved to Mourinho that informing Costa he would not start a game is about as comfortable as snuffing out the forwardâs threat in the six-yard box.
Then there is Fàbregas. When he was overwhelmed by Swansea and, arguably, by Schalke at times on Wednesday, Chelsea rather ran aground. He is the imagination in the middle, a creatorâinâchief while Eden Hazard dazzles from the flank and others stretch opponents with sheer pace. Opponents seek to snuff him out at source and, while the Spaniard can be spiky, Ramires and Matic are often required almost as minders. Mourinho has described Fàbregasâs arrival as having âcompleted the jigsaw, leaving us with a team that still has many years to grow with its own identityâ. He added: âI knew his qualities: age, experience, tactical culture, made in England, made in the âCityâs team are almost the same as last season, no? They brought three or four important players in: a very good goalkeeper [Willy Caballero], Fernando, Sagna and Mangala... very good players. They have a fantastic squad and are not just the champions, but twice champions in three years. Thereâs a reason for that. Chelsea have not won the Premier League for a few years now. Thereâs a reason for that, also but at this moment we can. We have improved our squad and our team. We have more solutions, a couple of players with qualities we didnât have last season. We have the ammunition to defend and go on the counter and, if we can have the ball, thank you very much. We want it.â
A meeting with City, even this early in the campaign, offers an opportunity to showcase this teamâs progress. Chelsea have struck upon the scintillating style long craved by the owner in the past. Sometimes it appears to have arrived, only to come unstuck against stronger opposition. The expansive football summoned at the start of the 2010-11 campaign under Carlo Ancelotti serves as a warning: Chelsea scored 21 times in winning their first five league games that season, only to lose the sixth 1-0 at City, the first elite opposition they met. The Italian was sacked immediately after the final match of that trophyless campaign. The hope is that things are different this time around.
âI cannot knock on the ownerâs door, or call him to ask: âMr Abramovich, are you happy?ââ Mourinho added. âBut my feeling is that he is. The team are playing well. The team are getting good results. The way the team plays â not just with our philosophy but the way we are targeting every competition â everything is positive.â Perfection may still be some way off but there is potential here. Chelseaâs work in progress is already promising.
