Nathaniel Clyne, who not that long ago fretted about holding down a first-team place at Crystal Palace in the Championship, has targeted regular involvement in the Having excelled during his clubâs impressive start to the Premier League season under their new manager Ronald Koeman, the 23-year-old Southampton full-back is set to make his debut in Thursdayâs Euro 2016 qualifier against San Marino at Wembley. John Stones, who played on the right in last monthâs victories over Norway and Switzerland, has been ruled out after suffering an ankle injury in Evertonâs defeat at Manchester United on Sunday. While Calum Chambers has been restored to the party from the Under-21s as cover, Clyne is the only out-and-out right-back in the 21-man squad in the absence of the injured Glen Johnson and Kyle Walker.
âI was just delighted to get the call-up and decided to phone up everyone I knew,â said Clyne, who moved from Palace to St Maryâs two years ago. âI called my mum first as she has been a big part of my career so far. She was crying on the phone. I am happy and I am proud and will go with England and show that I am capable of wearing the jersey.
âIt did come as a surprise to me. Iâm still up and coming in the game, and still need to improve. Hopefully this will be another step for me, to play for England, and a chance to improve even more. I know a lot of the players there, people like Jordan Henderson, Raheem Sterling and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain who played with me at the Under-21s. Also I know Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana from Clyne had made his Palace debut in the second tier as a 17-year-old and rapidly became a regular at the club, whose academy he had joined in his early teens. There had been some self-doubt in those early years, a reality reflected by his former team-mate Kieron Cadoganâs tweet last Thursday once confirmation had come through of the 23-year-oldâs elevation to the seniors. âUsed to drive this guy training and he would complain that he doubts heâll get in the 1st team at Palace â¦ Now look at him,â wrote Cadogan, a winger who left Palace in 2012 and, after spells with Aldershot and Barnet, now plays in Sweden at GAIS.
âThatâs definitely right,â acknowledged Clyne. âI have been on a long journey. I was fortunate to get into the Palace team eventually and, when I did, I made my mark and got through and now I am playing for Southampton and doing really well. The new manager has given me confidence. He says I can be one of the best right-backs in the Premier League. I have grown up, but I feel that I am good enough to be part of the England team. Now I have to show that.â
