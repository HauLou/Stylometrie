the Arsenal midfielder underwent a scan at a local hospital the following day, all those inevitable fears that his World Cup may be over before it had even begun clawing at him mercilessly.
He had attempted to block them out as best he could, but there were a few silent prayers offered up as the machine whirred away. âI sat in the scanner with the fingers crossed on both my hands for the whole 25 minutes,â he said. âAt the end I couldnât feel my fingers at all. Iâve just come back from a long-term knee injury so I know something that seems quite innocuous can set you back five months.
âSo, given the timing, you fear the worst. I knew immediately this wasnât as bad as the injury Iâd had back in August, but when the That was a swift return to the glowing positivity he has needed too often over the past year since rasping that glorious equaliser beyond Brazilâs Júlio César six minutes after coming on as a substitute at the Maracanã last summer. Oxlade-Chamberlain recognised the signs after Gruezoâs clumsy intervention because bitter experience has taught him how it feels to suffer a serious knee injury. Rewind to the opening day of the domestic season and a challenge with Aston Villaâs Antonio Luna had condemned him to the treatment room.
The winger initially thought he had suffered a dead leg only for scans to reveal he had severely strained the posterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. It would be a little under five months before he would play again. Throw in a nagging groin complaint that required rest over the run-in and his has been a horribly interrupted campaign.
Not that it was obvious as he tore into Ecuador 10 days ago, setting up Englandâs equaliser and constantly unsettling the left side of the defence. âIâd felt really good against Ecuador. For the first time in about eight weeks, I hadnât felt my groins or any other little niggles. The work Iâd done at my club at the back end of the season had paid off, and Iâd continued that with England since coming away, and I was feeling really good, up until my knee took a bit of a knock.
âIt opened up the ligament so the first thing you feel is pain. I didnât feel anything pop, at least, but you still spend the next 10 seconds trying to figure out how painful it is, how bad it could be. Then you get up and try and walk it off and, if you canât, you panic a bit more.
âI sat in the dressing room and thought: âYou canât get yourself in a pickle and down because the situation is not going to change. What has happened has happened. You either stay positive and look forward, and how you get over it, or you do the opposite and get yourself down. And that is not going to get you anywhere.â Ever since Iâve put my head down and cracked on. I know I can hit the ground running when Iâm fit again. I hadnât started since the FA Cup semi-final [on 12 April] before the Ecuador game, and I still felt sharp. When I came back from the five-month injury it did take a bit longer to get into the swing of it, but with short-termers itâs easier to hit the ground running.â
His experience of the tournament is as an armchair viewer, watching matches on television in the teamâs hotel in between games of corridor cricket, wall tennis and, more conventionally, snooker. There has been one strop in defeat already, when he surrendered a frame to Wayne Rooney after inadvertently potting the white as he sunk the final black â âIt would have been the best comeback of my life, but I just stormed off to my roomâ â with his eagerness to play a part on the pitch proper all too obvious.
This is Oxlade-Chamberlainâs second major finals, having featured at Euro 2012, which makes him feel almost established in the set-up, though he is one of the youngsters around whom the future of this team will be built. âItâs funny because thereâs been so much talk about the young boys in the squad: Ross Barkley, Raheem [Sterling] and Luke [Shaw], but my name never gets mentioned. Iâm the same age as Ross, a year older than Raheem and younger than a lot of the other boys. But I do feel more comfortable. I have been in or around the squad for the last two years and I feel at home. We want the same thing to happen to Luke and Ross come the next tournament. That brings the best out of your football.
âBut, being here, itâs what you dream of as a kid growing up. The moment the Brazilians sung the national anthem, with tears in their eyes, brought it to life for me. Usually, theyâre such cool customers, but that was so passionate. I have that nice memory from the Maracanã last year which I can cling to for the rest of my life, and that was a taste, but emulating that feeling at a World Cup is a massive motivation.
âI remember watching David Beckham scoring that free-kick at Old Trafford to take England to a World Cup. Things like that stick with you. I was at Southsea, waiting to board a hovercraft for the Isle of Wight. We ended up missing it because we were more interested in watching the big screen.
âIf I get the chance, Iâll go out there and be positive and try and make my mark. I donât mind where I play. When I play in central midfield thatâs my favourite position. When I play out wide and maybe score a goal, thatâs my favourite position. When I played in goal at Stamford Bridge I realised thatâs not my best position.â
That was a reference to his punching away a wayward Eden Hazard shot back in mid-March only for his team-mate, Kieran Gibbs, to be erroneously sent off. The joke offered another flash of positivity. The hope is Oxlade-Chamberlain has his chance to showcase more than good humour in Brazil in the weeks ahead.
