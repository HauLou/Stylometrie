Gary Cahill says Chelseaâs players have already discussed among themselves the considerable challenge that awaits next season as they defend their Premier League title.
José Mourinhoâs side claimed the championship for the first time in five years, by a comfortable eight-point margin, and now hope to emulate his team of a decade ago by securing back-to-back titles. Yet the Chelsea squad are acutely aware of the travails endured by last yearâs champions, Manchester City, when attempting to retain the trophy and are steeled for a more threatening challenge from the chasing pack.
âWe have spoken among ourselves and we know it will be even harder to retain it,â said Cahill, who featured in all but two of Chelseaâs Premier League games last season. âThe top teams in our league all pose threats, and they are going to provide bigger challenges next year. After Manchester City won the league, the following season whenever anyone played City they knew that they were up against the reigning champions so there was that added pressure on them and an added incentive for everyone playing them.
âThatâs natural â that added incentive to beat the reigning champions, because theyâd been the best the season before â and we will feel that next year. Itâll be even harder to retain it. Iâve never experienced this before because that was my first league title, but the senior boys in the squad and the management know what it takes, and itâs going to be harder, not least because thereâll be movement in the summer to strengthen teams.â
The champions will also seek to add up to four senior players to their ranks with the manager pushing for the loan arrival of Radamel Falcao from Monaco, and interest expressed in the likes of Antoine Griezmann and Toby Alderweireld at Atlético Madrid. There is intent, too, to offer academy graduates such as Ruben Loftus-Cheek more game time in the senior side.
The England Under-21 internationalâs performance in a post-season friendly against Sydney FC drew criticism from Mourinho last week, a shot across the bows presumably designed to ensure he maintains standards through his development. âThat did surprise me a little bit, but you know the manager,â added Cahill. âHe voices his opinion when he needs to. Everyone knows Ruben is such a talented player. We had a glimpse of that at the end of the season, and he has trained with us for a long time now: for me, he has everything. But to reach the top of your profession or at any top club you will get criticism, whether itâs from fans or the manager.â
