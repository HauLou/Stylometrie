The Khedira was a member of Joachim Löwâs side that was beaten by Spain in the semi-finals at the last World Cup, the Real Madrid player going on to score the goal that defeated Uruguay in the third-place play-off. The Germans have reached the last four of the past two World Cups and European Championships, losing the final of Euro 2008 to Spain, suggesting they have become the nearly men of the international game.
