Those ensconced among the chasing pack might acknowledge just how sinister even a routine The industrious Oscar followed up his winning goal in midweek against Bolton in the Capital One Cup with a smartly taken opener here, supplied by his compatriot who would go on to cap a comfortable success by prodding in a third from Aly Cissokhoâs unwitting assist late on. Oscar painted a glowing picture of his personal state of mind post-match. âI have had time [to readjust],â he said. âMourinho told me that he has a lot of players, so I didnât play against Manchester City, or Schalke at the start. But I started against Bolton and here, and I played well because I am not tired and am in good condition. I have forgotten the World Cup.â
That admission hinted at the psychological effects of that 7-1 mauling by Germany in Belo Horizonte, when a nationâs aspirations were so brutally trodden underfoot. Mourinho is unconvinced. âWeâve not spoken about the World Cup, and some of the players even make fun of each other about it,â he said. âNobody was really affected like that. Itâs physical. Players need holidays, a proper pre-season, and they havenât had them. Willian didnât start the season well. Oscar is the same. But now they are getting into the intensity of the game again.â
The Chelsea manager foresees arguably worse problems next summer, when there are European Championship qualifiers in June and the Copa América scheduled until early July. âFor a World Cup some teams donât qualify but, for those international fixtures, every player has to go with his national team,â he said. âThey are going to have two weeksâ pre-season. I donât even speak about the Copa América. Iâm trying to forget that. If not I sell all the South American players ...â That was said with a smile.
This team is thriving around its Latin contingent with the domestic momentum all theirs going into next Sundayâs derby against Arsenal. Chelsea have a tricky contest at Sporting Lisbon before then with Costa, whose header secured an eighth goal in his first six Villa, so impressive in those early weeks of term, lacked bite of their own on Saturday with Gabriel Agbonlahor isolated and well shackled, and no Christian Benteke or Libor Kozak to lead their line. The Belgian, absent since March with a ruptured Achilles tendon, could play a behind-closed-doors friendly this week and might even be on the bench against City on Saturday. âHe has been training for a couple of weeks and, thankfully, there has been no reaction,â âHe is not too far away,â said Villa manager Paul Lambert. âEveryone in the team will be grateful when he is back and with what he hands us is an attacking force. Weâll see how he feels.
âHeâs one of the best No9s Iâve seen, even as a player, and I played with no slouches: three of the best strikers in the world at one time in Karl-Heinz Riedle, Stéphane Chapuisat [at Borussia Dortmund] and Henrik Larsson [at Celtic]. They werenât bad.â Bentekeâs return should soothe some of the pain of successive defeats.
