And yet, in the four weeks from the opening defeat of Bosnia and Herzegovina to a first final in 24 years, against Germany at an expectant Maracanã, this team have had to improvise. Di María, or This has been a curious tournament for Higuaín. He had arrived with a reputation to uphold. Rewind four years to South Africa and he had become the third Argentinian to register a hat-trick at the finals, courtesy of his haul against South Korea in Johannesburg, and added another goal against Mexico in the last 16. The former Real Madrid forward had scored only one goal fewer than Messi in qualifying for Brazil with his tally for his country now an impressive 22 in 43 caps. The most recent, that wonderfully instinctive swivel and finish against the Belgians in Brasília, was a reminder of his qualities. Higuaín can be the natural reference point for this attack. And yet he had laboured through the group stage, his confidence apparently shorn and his luck decidedly out.
A month-long absence with an ankle complaint towards the end of his first campaign at Napoli had clearly knocked him back, with his form rather sluggish despite a poacherâs 17-goal haul in his first season in Serie A. The goal against Belgium was his first in six appearances for the against the Swiss, and the space his selfless movement opened up for Messi or Di María.

That was arguably Argentinaâs best chance in São Paulo.
The reality is that, where many had hoped he might be a stellar performer to challenge for the tournamentâs golden boot, Higuaín has become a high-profile cog in the collective that has squeezed Now they will lean on him more than ever. In the showpiece he must occupy Jérôme Boateng and Mats Hummels, close down Philipp Lahm and Benedikt Höwedes, as well as attempting to disrupt Bastian Schweinsteiger as he seeks to shackle Messi. If that was not enough, his country crave him rediscovering that scoring knack by playing Jorge Valdano to Messiâs Diego Maradona. Valdano, another former Real Madrid forward, scored four times at Mexico 86 â he managed only seven in his 23 caps â including a goal in the final against West Germany and was a key member of Carlos Bilardoâs formation, leading the line with Maradona in the free role at his back. Their partnership felt comfortable.
Now, given the injuries that have limited
