Perhaps a surprise inclusion these days but utterly unflustered and reliable. Rarely called upon to excel but still oozed authority Big influence on the right, at both ends, or dropping into central zones to assist fellow defenders. A nuisance at attacking set plays Exorcised his Kane-inspired nightmares by imposing himself whenever he could on the striker, attention that eventually resulted in a booking Had already proved a tower of defensive strength before venturing upfield to volley his team ahead. Inspired those around him 
Ended bloodied and bandaged having taken Dierâs knee to the head but still flung himself at everything in the closing stages The energy in the centre of midfield and, while initially eclipsed by Spursâ young centre, he was a pest when his team sought to counter No Nemanja Matic but generally succeeded in starving Eriksen of space in which to thrive, which was all José Mourinho askedInitially rather careless but grew into the contest and played a role in both goals to show why Mourinho leans so heavily upon him Sluggish at times, perhaps hindered by recent fitness issues, but retained ability to thread a decisive pass from which Costa could thrive The one  At his spiky best, riling Dier and escaping a caution for palming off the youngster. How Spurs craved someone similarly streetwise Wrongfooted by deflections for both Chelsea goals, with the reality he did well to deny Cahill and Fàbregas scant consolation Eager to push on down the flank but exposed by Hazardâs slippery running and not tight enough to Costa at Chelseaâs second 
Riled by Costa from the moment they clashed five minutes in. Booked and perhaps fortunate subsequent offences went unnoticed Should have taken the lead to counter Costaâs aggression, and does not appear to direct or influence those around him as much as he should Tested by Hazard but offered pace and width going forward. His eagerness was refreshing and he might have deserved better A blur of energy in Spursâ midfield, driving his team forward, but he must ally that with better composure in his shooting Looks a classy and comfortable player, working in tandem with Mason, and his influence will grow in time. Never overawed Direct and eager in possession to test Azpilicueta, plenty of urgency down the flank, although unable to conjure a telling delivery Belted an early free-kick on to the bar to promise much but, thereafter, was otherwise peripheral where Spurs needed him to be integral Should offer so much more given his physique but he air-kicked at his best opportunity and only offered occasional flashes of his quality Dropped deep to inspire two early chances, dribbling at panicked opponents, but denied a goal by Terryâs fine block
