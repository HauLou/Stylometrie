The perennial understudy can finally emerge from the shadows. Ashley Cole is absent, the player capped 105 times was back at Cobham undergoing treatment on a rib injury, with the onus on Baines to prove his credentials with the national team when the pressure is on. The 28-year-old's pedigree is long established at Premier League level, his excellence consistent at both ends of the pitch. The clamour for his selection ahead of Cole has been long-standing, regardless that the older man's powers are hardly diminished.
With England, though, Baines' appearances have been limited in the more critical ties. Only six of his 19 caps have been in competitive fixtures in an international career that started in February 2010, the majority in anticipated turkey shoots and his most demanding coming in the draw with Ukraine at Wembley 13 months ago when the hosts, as a whole, underwhelmed. When There was always an argument that Baines, armed with arguably the best set-piece delivery since David Beckham and brimming with busy, attacking intent, should have been selected regardless of Cole's availability for fixtures England simply have to win to guarantee automatic qualification from Group H. England can expect to hog possession on Friday, and Baines should provide an outlet wide and a thrust down the flank. Glance at the figures for last season and the case for his inclusion is persuasive. His defensive numbers were hardly shabby, with 92 tackles and a 79.3% success rate, the latter impressive given Everton's defence might expect to be marginally busier than Chelsea's in most of the Premier League games they play.
But those which truly caught the eye were in offensive areas: 116 chances created for Everton team-mates, 241 crosses fizzed into the penalty area, and five goals en route. The two free-kicks from which he scored last month at West Ham were a reminder of the bite and accuracy on which England may yet come to depend against stubborn opponents in the week ahead. The hope is that the self-confidence, which has swelled at club level as a linchpin of an impressive side, is as evident with the national team, and that Hodgson actively encourages the full-back to maraud forward in conjunction with a left-sided attacker, presumably Danny Welbeck, to stretch a Montenegro intent on frustrating.
Perhaps the timing of the elevation might have been better. Baines, like Everton, has flourished in flashes this season though there are extenuating circumstances for bouts of inconsistency. He has missed the injured Steven Pienaar, with whom he had struck up such a productive partnership hugging the flank, that instinctive understanding with the South African having been so key to the team's approach. Pienaar has not featured since the end of August, but the team are still adjusting to life under Roberto Martínez. Where once When Baines finally builds up a head of steam he can find opponents settled back into shape, a reality which poses different problems. "It's a work in progress and nobody is going to be at their best every week, but I'm learning," he told the Liverpool Echo after Saturday's defeat at Manchester City. "We've been working on different things. Playing at Goodison Park in the first half last Monday night [against Newcastle] you could start to see it come together. We were brilliant in that game. We've just got to tighten up the other aspects and keep developing." He is, of course, a known quantity, a rival of whom to be wary. His reputation precedes him these days.
All the intrigue surrounding that potential move to Manchester United did not help, either, even if the player dealt with an unsettling period as professionally as Everton could have hoped. In the end the Merseyside club had no decision to make over the left-back's future, the offers submitted by United having fallen well under-value, though Baines â who was admirably unwilling to force the issue â would have relished the chance to compete in the Champions League. That is where Cole so regularly excels, and where he consistently steels himself for international football. Baines does not have that same opportunity, but wound Montenegro and Poland and he can stake his own claim for future inclusion. His former manager at Wigan, Paul Jewell, had always told him he would eventually usurp Cole. Now he can do so on merit.
