Steve Bruce bemoaned Chris Foyâs decision not to dismiss Gary Cahill for what he described as a dive more befitting the ballet as Hull City endured a ninth match without a win after succumbing to the Premier League leaders, Chelsea.
The official booked two home players, Willian and Diego Costa, for simulation during a disjointed contest but opted against showing Cahill, already booked for a bad foul on Sone Aluko, a second yellow card after he tumbled between Tom Huddlestone and David Meyler apparently in search of a penalty. Huddlestoneâs frustration subsequently overcame him and he was dismissed for an ugly challenge on Filipe Luis.
âIâve been asked if Cahill should have gone and the simple answer is yes,â said Bruce. âEspecially given the referee has booked two people for simulation or diving. The likes of Oscar, Hazard or Willian are running at pace so the smallest connection can bring them over, but this is Englandâs centre-half. It could have been a red card, his first half challenge on [Sone] Aluko. That was reckless and dangerous. But when you watch [the dive] over, itâs like something out of Swan Lake. Itâs that blatant, that obvious what heâs trying to do.
âThereâs no justification for it. Heâs taken off thinking Meyler is going to challenge him, looking to win the penalty. In Latin countries itâs applauded but people enjoy the âThat was not a hard decision and you expect the referee to do his job. He was only 10 yards away. Tom, who is the most laidback person, is frustrated with the decisions and produced a horror challenge which deserves a red card. And yet thereâs some excuse theyâll find for it.â
Hull had trailed to Eden Hazardâs opener when Cahill took to the turf, with Costa adding a second against 10 men. âI donât believe Cahill dived,â said José Mourinho, whose side retain a three-point advantage at the top. âIf you tell me Iâm wrong because he did, then something happened. Or they blocked his run. Or they touched. Or he lost balance. But that big, honest guy? I donât believe he dived in the oppositionâs box.
âWith Willian, if he wants to dive, he doesnât dive on the midfield line. He dives in the box. Willian had a red card with Mr Foy last year [at Aston Villa in March] and, after, we realised there wasnât even a touch on Fabian Delph in that incident.â
