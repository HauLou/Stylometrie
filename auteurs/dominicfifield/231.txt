The former England captain was encouraged by the teamâs display in their League Cup quarter-final win at Bournemouth on Wednesday, only their third victory in 11 games in all competitions and a timely result given last Sundayâs 3-0 loss at Manchester United, but will demand standards are maintained when league duties resume at Anfield.
Brendan Rodgersâs side have won only twice in eight top-flight games and languish in the lower half of the table, 18 points from the summit, prompting Gerrardâs rallying cry in the belief the team can still instigate a revival.
âItâs been tough of late, I canât deny that,â said the midfielder. âItâs been a bit of a rollercoaster so to get a good win at Bournemouth is a big lift and a lift that is very welcome. We did well as an attacking unit at Old Trafford. The difference was we made mistakes there and got punished by world-class players. At Bournemouth we cut the mistakes out and the first half was a very pleasing performance, probably as close as weâve come to last seasonâs standards. But we need to keep going, keep winning.
âWe have a tough game at the weekend against Arsenal and then we have a run of fixtures which are a bit more kind to us. If we can get a big result against Arsenal and build on this, we can turn it around. Itâs been very hard. Iâve experienced it a few times during my career at âWe canât have players hiding and feeling sorry for ourselves. Everyone knows if we perform back to how we have done of late against Arsenal weâll get beat. We need men out there and, on Wednesday, I thought we all turned up. Thatâs why the result came.â
Gerrard has spoken to his club-mates, both collectively and individually, to remind them of their responsibilities in the hope they can recover from elimination from the Champions League and their sloppy opening to the domestic campaign. âBut if youâre sitting in that dressing room and you donât know that the performance levels havenât been good enough of late, youâre at the wrong place,â he said.
Last seasonâs home game against Arsenal had summed up all that was good about this team at the time â a blistering start, inspired by Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suárez, which blew the visitors away early on â with a reshaped line-up now hoping to produce a similar performance.
âWe won that game in the first 20 minutes but when you have a strike force of Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suárez, they are capable of killing teams in 20 minutes,â said Gerrard. âItâs different this year and everyone knows that. I think they provided 60-70% of our goals, those two. You take them out of any team in the world and itâs going to be tough, and it has been. But I think this is where you find out what kind of players youâve got in the dressing room. Itâs time to roll your sleeves up and fight for the club and try to put it right as soon as possible and thatâs what weâre trying to do.â
There has been pressure, too, on Rodgers with the teamâs major summer purchases having struggled to make a positive impact and spluttering form eroding a reputation forged on last seasonâs startling success. The manager has had to cope with the added pressures of European football as well as raised expectations but while there is empathy from his senior players, there is also an acceptance that criticism is inevitable.
âIt comes with the territory,â added Gerrard. âThere was a stage where a couple of my performances were under par and I got a bit of stick. Itâs normal. Iâve got to accept it being captain of the club, and heâs got to accept it being the manager of Liverpool. If results donât go well, questions are going to be asked, criticism is going to fly, you take it on the chin and try to improve things. Thatâs the only way.
âI know when I donât play well. Every individual does here. But I think, collectively, it has been tough. Itâs been tough to perform because we havenât played well as a team and so there have been tough days of late. But if we keep fighting, keep performing, roll our sleeves up, keep giving everything weâve got, Iâm sure the good days are not too far away.â
