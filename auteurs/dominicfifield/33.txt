Bilic was confirmed as Sam Allardyceâs successor on Tuesday after signing a three-year contract at Upton Park, where he played for 18 months in the mid-1990s. The move comes before a critical period in the clubâs history given the move to the Olympic Stadium next year. The former Croatia manager left Besiktas after two seasons last month and marked his return to the Premier League by targeting a top-10 finish next year and, potentially, Champions League qualification in the seasons ahead.
West Hamâs co-owners, David Gold and David Sullivan, will grant him the tools to meet those initial aspirations with the clubâs head of recruitment, Tony Henry, actively pursuing a number of targets with Rémy a potential marquee arrival. The France international, who joined Chelsea from Queens Park Rangers for £8.5m last summer, started only six Premier League games as the title went to Stamford Bridge for the first time in five years and would favour greater involvement at club level next season as he attempts to secure a place in the hostsâ squad at the 2016 European Championship finals.
José Mourinho would be reluctant to lose a forward who he considers has a role to play in the squad but the Chelsea manager has already made clear he will not attempt to retain anyone who wishes to leave. Both Crystal Palace and Swansea City are also monitoring the 28-year-oldâs situation, and would provide regular football, but West Ham would hope to offer him the most appealing salary package as one of a number of new arrivals in the close season. There was interest in Marseilleâs André Ayew, although he has decided to join Swansea, but the Sampdoria midfielder Pedro Obiang is expected to join for £4.6m, while Bilicâs own list of favoured additions includes the Turkey internationals Gokhan Tore, formerly of Chelsea, and Olcay Sahan who both played for him at Besiktas.
West Ham are also exploring the possibility of securing the teenage Croatia midfielder Alen Halilovic on a season-long loan from Barcelona, where he has featured regularly for the B side, with Bilic aware of what he is expected to produce in his new role. âMy nature is very optimistic, but realistically optimistic,â he said. âI hope weâre going to achieve big things with West Ham. Iâve been in football a long time and, wherever you go, the ambition is sky high. But with West Ham, I found the ambitions to be realistic and the ambition is right: to try to be top 10, definitely, and then improve on that.
âFirst season, if we can finish eighth, ninth or 10th then, in the space of a few seasons, with the stadium and everything â with hype, with probably a little bit more budget, with good planning and good play â nobody can stop us dreaming of European places or, if we have a brilliant season, to try to break into the Champions League places. To win a trophy, to win a cup. You have to believe in that to achieve it. It is a special club, and that made my decision quite easy, but the most important [thing] was the ambition of the club.â
West Ham, who finished 12th last season, had considered a number of high-profile candidates for the role vacated by Allardyce only for their interest in the likes of Carlo Ancelotti, Unai Emery, Jürgen Klopp, Rafael Benítez, Michael Laudrup and Marcelo Bielsa â who is expected to remain at Marseille â to be thwarted. Bilic has emotional ties with Upton Park, stemming from his 54 appearances as a player, but needed to convince the owners and the vice-chairman, Karren Brady, that he had the necessary experienceto ensure the London club maintain the progress instigated by Allardyce.
While he excelled with Croatia, most notably at Englandâs expense in qualifying for Euro 2008, his one season at Lokomotiv Moscow ended in their worst league finish â ninth â since the Russian championship was formed in 1992. Besiktas, title winners in 2009, finished third in each campaign under the 46-year-oldâs stewardship. âSome of the best days of my football life were during my one and a half seasons with West Ham,â added Bilic, who watched the tail end of the clubâs âItâs impossible to have a bigger bond with a club in such a small period of time. I clicked with the players, the fans, with everybody. So it is a privilege to be in charge of the team for its last season playing in a stadium theyâve played in for such a long time. It is a big responsibility to be manager and I hope I will prove [myself] to the board, players and fans. I will give my best and, together, we will achieve great things.â
