Martina, who has been capped 20 times by the Dutch Caribbean island of Curaçao, played under Erwin Koeman â brother to the Southampton manager Ronald, and assistant coach at St Maryâs â at RKC Waalwijk and has spent the last two years at Twente. The 25-year-oldâs versatility will benefit a squad who will compete in the Europa League in the campaign ahead, with Martina a natural right-back but able to fill in on the left or in central midfield.
âWe are interested in him and itâs close, itâs close,â said 
Morgan Schneiderlin was absent at the Staplewood training ground on Monday due to illness but will travel to Austria, with Southampton braced for an improved offer from Manchester United for the France internationalâs services. An initial bid of £20m was turned down last month. âHe was ill, and heâs coming tomorrow to do training,â said Koeman. âHe will travel with the rest of the squad to Austria. He was not feeling well, had contact with the doctor, and stayed at home today. We had two weeks ago a bid from Manchester United. It wasnât enough and no more bids up to today.
âEverybody knows Morganâs situation. I understand that, if he can get a good move to a big [club], I understand it. But I hope if there is any business that itâs soon, because thatâs best for the player and for us. We have to prepare for what weâd have to do if we sell the player. I had a lot of meetings with Morgan [last season]. I had another one last week with Morgan. Everybody knows his situation. But itâs important for the player to do a good pre-season. We will see what happens in the next few days.â
Koeman confirmed that Southamptonâs executive director, Les Reed, is in dialogue with Atlético Madrid over the transfer of Toby Alderweireld after the Spanish club failed to cancel the buy-out clause in time after the Belgium international spent last season on loan at St Maryâs. The south-coast club are still intent upon securing Alderweireld for £6.8m, the buy-out clause which formed part of his loan.

Atlético had the option to cancel that agreement by paying a fee of £1.5m, but they missed the deadline to do so, meaning Southampton are entitled to sign the defender despite Tottenham Hotspur having since expressed a willingness to pay nearer £11.5m for his services. âSouthampton signed an option for the player, and Atlético Madrid tried to buy back the option, but it was too late,â said Koeman. âWhat happened with Tottenham in the middle, I donât know. Seriously, I donât know. Les Reed is working on that situation and I await more news about that situation with Toby. We want him back, of course, and the player told us the same.â
Asked when Alderweireld had indicated a desire to return, the Dutch manager added: âBefore the summer. I had a message by mobile with Toby [since], but thatâs private. I mentioned that weâd had a talk with Toby before the end of the season and he was very happy about Southampton and we mentioned to the player weâd like to continue with him. That was the case with Atlético as well. After that, I donât know.â
