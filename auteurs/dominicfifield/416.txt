Uruguay have followed Luis Suárez in departing the James Rodríguez was afforded a deafening reception upon his departure five minutes from time here, the tournamentâs leading scorer having scored the goals that eased his wonderfully impressive side into a quarter-final against Brazil on Friday. The 22-year-old had arrived at the tournament with his reputation established at Porto and after a year at Monaco, where he had cost the French club £40m, yet his effervescent displays at these finals are already making that fee seem a bargain. No opponent to date has found a way of stopping Colombiaâs principal playmaker. Brazil do not have long to come up with a plan.
He glides with such menace, his touch sublime and awareness almost unnatural for one gracing these finals for the first time. This team purred when Rodríguez found space and time on the ball at the Maracanã, his movement clever as he interchanged with a fluid and potent front line. Juan Cuadrado is flourishing at his side. Jackson Martínez is aggressive, eager and clever in positioning and delivery. Teófilo Gutiérrez appears willing to offer up selfless industry as the furthest forward of an impressive front-line. And to think their number might have been complemented by Radamel Falcao, Rodríguezâs team-mate at the Stade Louis II and himself a £60m striker recently considered this teamâs stellar talent. While the teamâs nine-goal inspiration from qualification continues his rehabilitation from a knee ligament injury on holiday in Florida, his compatriots are running riot.
This game had ambled along cagily for almost half an hour, Uruguay tigerishly setting about stifling any hint of Colombian ascendancy, when Abel Aguilar nodded the ball forward to Rodríguez, loitering with his back to goal in a pocket of space just outside the The youngster tore off to the corner flag to conduct another of those choreographed celebrations, his hips snapping in familiar style with this a sixth game in succession for his country in which he has scored. âIt was one of the greatest goals the World Cup has ever seen,â said Óscar Tabárez in the aftermath, the Uruguay manager going on to compare James Rodríguez to Diego Maradona, Lionel Messi and, pointedly, Suárez. âHeâs the best player in the World Cup, I donât think Iâm exaggerating.â Unfortunately for Uruguay, Rodríguez had not finished there.
Where that first had been reward conjured from thin air, a goal to defy belief, his second was constructed with the kind of slick precision that truly drains the hope from opponents. The kind of goal that renders them helpless. José Pékermanâs players revelled in patient possession, transporting the ball from one flank to the other and resisting the temptation to overelaborate, forever probing in search of an opening. Uruguay were powerless to steal it from them and, eventually Pablo Armero marauded forward in support to accept possession on the charge and cross to the far post where Cuadrado carefully headed back and across and an unmarked Rodríguez tapped in.
Cuadradoâs fourth assist of the tournament had provided the No10âs fifth goal, this contest settled thereafter with Colombia â in stark contrast to Brazil earlier in the day â able to ease through the remainder of the tie in relative comfort. It is remarkable to consider Colombia have never progressed this far before, their only previous knockout game having been lost to Roger Milla and Cameroon back at Italia 90. Yet Uruguay, of course, could justifiably point to their own challenge being blunted in Suárezâs absence, Luisito back at his holiday home in Solymar watching on television when Tabárez needed him out in the Maracanã. Without him, they lacked an attacking focal point, with Diego Forlánâs career in its twilight and Edinson Cavani strangely peripheral at this tournament. David Ospina kept them at bay here, denying Álvaro González, Cristian Rodríguez and Pereira, the latter from close range, but there was a desperation to the Uruguayansâ approach.
It might have been different had Suárez been there to lead the line and make his mark, in a footballing sense, on the shoulder of the centre-halves. Though taming this Colombian selection would probably still have been beyond them. Tabárez was realistic when acknowledging his sideâs time at this tournament was simply up. Colombia, in contrast, have plenty more to give.
