Chelsea have finally confirmed the arrival of Falcao, who managed only four goals in 29 appearances during a similar stint with Manchester United last season, will join up with his new club-mates during their pre-season tour of North America.

âI am very happy to be joining Chelsea and canât wait to start training and help with our aim of retaining the league title and being successful in Europe,â said Falcao, who had excelled with River Plate, Porto and Atlético Madrid before his £50m move to Monaco in the summer of 2013.

The Croatian, signed from Hajduk Split last summer and loaned to Elche in La Liga last term, will now spend the new campaign developing his game in the south of France. Marseille have joined Rayo Vallecano in inquiring with the Premier League champions over the possibility of taking the 18-year-old forward Jeremie Boga, a native of the city, on a season-long loan.
