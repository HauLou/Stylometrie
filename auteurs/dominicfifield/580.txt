Powell was sacked on Monday evening after talks on a contract extension broke down, with owner and manager unable to reach agreement over their long-term vision. Charlton prop up the division and will be overseen by Riga, who has spent two spells as a coach at Standard Liège, for the first time in Wednesday's home game against Huddersfield Town. The Belgian will be assisted by Karel Fraeye, who has departed his position as head coach of Eendracht Zele.
Both have close links to Duchâtelet, 67, who had completed his £14m takeover in January to incorporate Charlton into a network of six clubs in which he has a financial interest at various levels across Europe. He revealed last week that he effectively sees the English addition to his portfolio as a feeder club for Liège, whom he purchased in 2011 and who currently lead the Belgian Pro League with aspirations to compete in next season's Champions League.
Youngsters would move to The Valley from the Belgian club's Formation Centre to gain first-team experience, while the most talented players at Charlton's own academy could move in the opposite direction, an arrangement with which Powell was apparently uncomfortable.
Riga, accompanied by Fraeye, was at Charlton's Sparrows Lane training ground on Tuesday and watched on as Powell's existing coaching staff oversaw the first-team squad. The 56-year-old introduced himself to the players after training, by which time Duchâtelet had issued a statement confirming Powell had been relieved of his duties. "Given the club's position in the league and the number of important fixtures upcoming, I felt this difficult decision was unavoidable at this time," said the Belgian, who has amassed a personal fortune of £615m in the electronics industry and other business interests. "I can assure supporters this was not an easy decision but it has been made with the club's future in mind. Time will tell if it is the right decision."
Apart from his stints at Liège, Charlton's first foreign manager has also worked as a scout and analyst for the Belgium national team. He has advised Milan's youth set-up since last October, spent time with the Aspire Academy in Qatar, and was invited by José Mourinho to spend a week at Real Madrid in November 2011 training the squad. He has spoken of forever "looking for innovation and progress" in his approach to coaching, and has worked with Michel Bruyninckx to design the CogiTraining and Senseball methods of coaching, aimed at heightening players' speed of vision and decision-making on the pitch.
He faces a challenge in retaining Charlton's The manager had first considered his future towards the end of January after initial disagreements with the new owner, though the pair had since opened negotiations over a new deal. A financial package had actually been agreed in principle, though Powell and Duchatelet were at odds over transfer strategy. Players such as Dale Stephens and Yann Kermorgant had been sold in January, with five of Charlton's six signings in the midwinter window boasting links with other clubs in the owner's network of teams â he controls Liège, the Hungarian side Ujpest, FC Carl Zeiss Jena in Germany and the Spanish team AD Alcorcon, and has interests in the Belgian team Sint-Truiden â and not handpicked by the manager.
None of the new additions were included in the starting lineup for Sunday's defeat at Bramall Lane, with the 2-0 defeat bringing matters to a head.
"We have been working with Chris Powell and his representatives for a couple of weeks to try and agree a contract extension which would have seen us continue to work together," said Duchâtelet. "There was good progress, but we could not reach an agreement over the club's football strategy going forward. The situation put a strain on the working relationship between Chris and the board. Therefore I think it is best for all parties that we part ways at this stage."
Powell, who said his farewells at the club's training ground on Tuesday morning, had steered Charlton to the League One title in 2012 before finishing an impressive ninth last term. However, this campaign has proved more problematic with restrictions on recruitment and the mid-season takeover, and Charlton have won only six of their 30 league games to date.
