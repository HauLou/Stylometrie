The 41-year-old had further tests on Monday. He also missed training and did not travel with the squad to Lancashire. The assistant coaches, Ruben Martínez and Javier Pereira, will take charge at Bloomfield Road.
García, who took Brighton to the Championship play-off semi-finals last season before a brief return to Israel with Maccabi, was appointed at Vicarage Road this month following the sudden departure of Beppe Sannino. It is understood García will be given ample time to make a full recovery and may be given an extended leave of absence if required.

A statement on Watfordâs website read: âThe club wishes Oscar a speedy recovery and will keep supporters fully updated about the head coachâs condition.â
