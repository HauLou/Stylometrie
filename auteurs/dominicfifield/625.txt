The cost of chasing a place in the Premier League has been exposed yet again after Brighton and Hove Albion posted a loss of £14.7m for last season, an increase of over £6m on the previous year's deficit, despite boasting the highest average attendance in the Brighton, then under the management of Gus Poyet, finished fourth in the second tier and were eliminated in the play-offs by Crystal Palace. The south coast club, currently ninth and seven points from the top six, are admired as one of the best run in the division and are making a concerted effort to fulfil the Football League's new financial fair play regulations, based on new Uefa rules. In that context, they must reduce their losses to £8m by December this year or technically face penalties.
"This set of results shows the reality of football in the Championship in recent years and demonstrates the very high cost of being competitive â with no guarantee of promotion to the Premier League," said the Albion chief executive, Paul Barber. "We had the highest average crowd in the Football League last season and we continued to grow revenues we can control. But in order to compete at the top end of the Championship, we had to once again rely on another considerable investment from our chairman, Tony Bloom."
The increase in wages and transfer fees, together with a fall in television revenue, saw the deficit increase from £8.6m the previous year. Football costs rose from £14.8m to £20.9m, though those figures should be eased next season. The club sold three players â Liam Bridcutt (to Sunderland for £2.5m), Ashley Barnes and Adam El-Abd â in January but felt confident enough that they will cut the deficit sufficiently to turn down interest in Will Buckley and Tomasz Kuszczak.
"We simply cannot sit back and rely on Tony's continued generosity alone," added Barber. "The new rules do not allow this. It is still new territory for all clubs and there has been much talk at both Premier League and Championship level about what other clubs are doing and whether they will comply. We remain absolutely committed to a long-term strategy for the club which ensures our future financial sustainability so, whilst it may not be a perfect system, we continue to agree with the principle of FFP."
