José Mourinho has claimed Hazard was one of the London clubâs most consistent performers last season with Mourinho pointing to the steady progress made by the 23-year-old in terms of developing tactical awareness and accepting defensive duties over his first year working with the player. Yet that education is far from complete and the manager had been publicly critical of the Belgianâs failure to track back and check a run by Atlético Madridâs Juanfran in the second leg of the Champions League semi-final in April, an error which cost his team an equaliser.
That was a reminder that this is a long-term process as Mourinho prepares to throw Hazard back into the competition in Wednesdayâs opening Group G fixture against âBut from a certain moment he started to have some tactical education, some mental education,â Mourinho added. âThereâs been a big improvement. Thatâs why weâre seeing heâs a top talent, a fantastic player. But now we want, because his talent allows him to, is to go from a top player to one of the greats of his generation. Thatâs what we think he can achieve, and why weâre proud that he thinks that Chelsea is the perfect environment for him to undertake that evolution. Thatâs why he wants to commit to us, and why we want him to commit for the future, too. Itâs true The deal should mean Hazard commands a weekly salary in the region of £200,000, ensuring he remains among the highest earners at Stamford Bridge, with the playmaker expected to start against a Schalke team horribly weakened by injuries, shorn of confidence after their worst start to a season in 46 years and still bruised by Saturdayâs 4-1 thrashing at Borussia Mönchengladbach. They will collide with a Chelsea side in scintillating form with Mourinho convinced his team are far stronger this season than last, when they finished third in the Premier League and reached the semi-finals of Europeâs elite competition.
The manager, bolstered by a fully fit squad, had claimed the âObviously there are teams and managers who work 10 or 15 years with the same team, and step by step with conditions to improve all the time. But I think the second season is a good space for evolution, for improvement. Itâs not easy to improve on what we did last season in terms of the table or the Champions League, but I think we are a better team. We are far from perfection but weâre a better group in better condition and playing better football.
âThe tournament is part of my history. I am part of the tournamentâs history. Itâs simple. If I win it once more, to win with three clubs is unique. Even if I donât do it, how many top managers in the world have only one or even not a single one? You have the example of [Sir Alex Ferguson], the greatest in our country who won it twice. Even if, from this moment, I donât win a single match in the Champions League, my history is there. I won it twice and thatâs fantastic, and something of which to be proud. But do I want to try and win it again? Of course I do. I have so many years ahead of me in terms of career. Obviously I have the ambition to win it again.
âBut in this moment, I only think about not playing in the Europa League. I want my club to succeed in the group stage. It would be very bad for the evolution of the group and the players to go into the Europa League, and for the clubâs prestige. Chelsea are not about the Europa League. We have to do everything we can to qualify for the knockout phase.â
