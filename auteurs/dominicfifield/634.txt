José Mourinho has provocatively suggested rival clubs have adopted a "dodgy" approach to Uefa's new financial fair play (FFP) regulations as the Chelsea manager prepares for Monday's daunting trip to the current leaders and fellow lavish spenders, Yet Chelsea have recouped over £55m with the sales of Juan Mata and Kevin de Bruyne and, despite announcing losses of £49.4m in the figures released on New Year's Eve, are confident they will satisfy all FFP rules.
Indeed, they had made a small profit the previous financial year. City, in contrast, have recorded losses of £150m in that time, the period submitted for FFP, with millions written off against the FFP regulations because they concerned investment in facilities and youth development. The league leaders have an annual wage bill of £233m but have exploited a loophole â as, indeed, have Chelsea â to avoid taking salaries into account on contracts signed before 2010.
The Europa League holders will buy a forward this summer, though that investment will apparently be made while still falling within FFP rules. "Some clubs are feeling financial fair play as 'fair' financial fair play and others are feeling FFP as a 'dodgy' financial fair play," said Mourinho.
"But, independent of that and independent of what other clubs do, next season, from day one of pre-season, I will say Chelsea are candidates to win the Premier League. This season I won't say that.
"We know what we want [in the summer]. We don't want to do things like emergency plans. It's not our profile now. The players we're signing now are the right ones for our future: Nemanja Matic, Mohamed Salah, Zouma, a young kid for the future ... We don't sign a striker now as an emergency plan to score half a dozen goals to give us half a dozen extra points, whatever they may mean for us. So we're waiting for the summer to do the right thing in that area. We just know basically what we want and we know what we want is impossible to get in this transfer window.
"We did other things this month, not the striker. I've said that for a couple of months. Nothing in January [for a forward]. Many people don't understand why we didn't do anything but, in the summer, you will understand why we didn't do anything [with the striker in January]."
