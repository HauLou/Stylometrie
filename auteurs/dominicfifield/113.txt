Now comes another apparent anomaly. Mondayâs opening goal against The clamour of âMurray for Englandâ is unlikely to go up any time soon but Roy Hodgson was at Selhurst Park to witness the bedlam of the club where the England manager began his playing career take their latest prize scalp. He will have appreciated the performance offered up by the journeyman leading the pack as well as the line.
These are heady days for a player whose nomadic career has taken in spells from Workington Reds to Wilmington Hammerheads in North Carolina, Barrow to Brighton & Hove Albion. He is a throwback, a targetman to whom the ball tends to stick and whose link-up play liberates team-mates. There were precious few opportunities for Yannick Bolasie and Wilfried Zaha to make inroads on Monday but they have each benefited from the presence of a central pivot of a striker around whom to buzz, just as they did in the second tier in that 2012-13 promotion season. Murray is not blessed with pace, even if he can rarely have been fitter than he currently appears, but he is canny. His movement is shrewd.
Experience earned from years muscling in among gnarled centre-halves in the lower leagues has brought the 31-year-old to the elite level. He drove Martín Demichelis and Vincent Kompany â a seasoned pair who boast a combined three Premier League titles, four Bundesligas, an FA Cup, four German Cups, three German League cups, two English League Cups and two Belgian league titles â to distraction, positioning his body cleverly to earn a flurry of free-kicks and relieve some of the pressure on Palace.
The tap-in, however disputed by City over Scott Dannâs perceived offside in the buildup, provided personal reward but Murrayâs game is selfless, his onus constantly on the collective. âI suppose it is one of the my best nights here,â he said with a monotone â the sentiment about as publicly emotive as the striker offers. âBut itâs a good night for the club. Ever since It is hard to begrudge him this success. Murray, like Grant Holt and Rickie Lambert before him, is making the most of a belated opportunity.
Unlike the Indian summers to lengthy careers that pair enjoyed at Norwich City and Southampton, however, Palaceâs No17 appeared to have been denied a chance he had earned. In May 2013, Palace hosted Murrayâs former club, Brighton, in the first leg of their Championship play-off semi-final when the 31-goal striker twisted in the visitorsâ penalty area under a vague challenge from Wayne Bridge and fell awkwardly, feeling the ligaments in his right knee wrench. The cruciate was ruptured, the teamâs talisman retiring in agony on a stretcher to the taunts of those in the away section. He watched the second leg and the Wembley final on crutches, and was then helpless as forwards were recruited in his absence while rehabilitation dragged on for almost 10 months.
His return under Tony Pulis last season yielded one goal, from the penalty spot at Swansea City, and signs of a partnership with Dwight Gayle but Murray was a player down the pecking order. Fraizer Campbell, Marouane Chamakh, Gayle and, for a while in January, potentially Yaya Sanogo or Shola Ameobi were all preferred in a team who tend to play only one up front.
Even Andrew Johnson was technically more in contention for involvement. Back on deadline day in September, Neil Warnock had sanctioned Murrayâs departure to Reading would have recruited Murray in January had Pardew not taken over, impressed as Reading were after eight goals in 18 games. Instead Murray signed a new deal at Selhurst Park, potentially extending his stay until 2017, and has been welcomed back into a team that is revived. He was the answer to the forward-line quandary all along. It just required a little faith to recognise as much.
The last five games have provided rewards aplenty: a stoppage-time goal and a header against a post in the seconds that still remained against Arsenal; two goals â and a sending off â when he was still rather rusty at West Ham United; key involvement as a central pivot as the wingers ran riot against Queens Park Rangers; a penalty and an assist at Stoke City; a tap-in and the free-kick from which Jason Puncheon scored the winner against the champions.
âHis was the performance of a No9 in the modern game,â Pardew said. âHe won free-kicks, won virtually every header, got a goal again. We knew weâd need him to buy us fouls, work hard for us, and that was exceptional. Heâs had a terrible time with injuries and should have been in the Premier League years ago but he has forged himself a great reputation in the game. Iâm so pleased for him. He deserved this a lot earlier in his career but now heâs getting the reward for the quality he has.â This Indian summer has time still to run. Murray has his opportunity at last.
