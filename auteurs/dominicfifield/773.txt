José Mourinho is willing to assist the Football Association's recently appointed commission looking into the declining number of Englishmen playing in the Barclays Premier League, even if the Chelsea manager pointed to the national side's success in qualifying for the World Cup as evidence that all is not as grim as has recently been depicted.
The Portuguese was at Wembley on Tuesday night to witness Roy Hodgson's side â which counted Chelsea's Gary Cahill and, by the end, Frank Lampard, in their number â defeat Poland to secure a place at the tournament in Brazil. That progress was timely given the FA chairman, Greg Dyke, has warned that the national side could slide into irrelevance unless urgent action is taken to improve the flow of young English talent, with his commission to report back by March having taken soundings from high-profile figures in the game.

It was a group without a big national team [as a rival], but it was a group with balance, with three or four teams who could take points off you. So it was a difficult group, and I think with the pressure of these last two matches â OK, they were at Wembley, in London, they had to win, and they did it â they coped well. They showed with the group of players they have that it's not the drama that some people want to make us believe it is. You see the players, and the players on the bench on Tuesday night: look at which clubs they play for, which competitions they play in â¦ You are speaking about some of the best players in the world."
The make-up of the commission has still to be concluded but includes the former England right-back Danny Mills, Dyke and the FA viceâchairman Roger Burden, the former England manager Glenn Hoddle, the League Managers Association chairman, Howard Wilkinson, the new Professional Footballers' Association chairman, Ritchie Humphreys, the Football League chairman, Greg Clarke, and the Crewe Alexandra director of football, Dario Gradi.
The England captain, Steven Gerrard, and his deputy, Frank Lampard, are also expected to be consulted by the panel as it focuses on what is blocking the progress of junior players to senior England level and whether coaching has been undervalued.
