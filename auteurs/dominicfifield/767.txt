A conference room overlooking the runway at Düsseldorf airport made for a soulless setting but, as José Mourinho doodled on a pad at his side, "My career is where it is because of this man," said the centre-half, with a nod to his manager one further along the top table. "I'm just very proud to be working with him again. He came in and laid the law down, saying: 'Listen, it's pretty simple. You play well and you're in the side. If not, you won't play.' From word go, when it was announced he was coming back, I was excited. I knew I needed to hit the ground running so I came back a week early for pre-season and made sure I was ready from day one, trying to impress him. Thankfully that's worked and I'm in the side. I'm happy with my form and the team is slowly getting to where we want to be."
Terry will start against Schalke in Tuesday's distinctly awkward This was a relatively rare public appearance from a centre-back who had felt rather marginalised at times last term. His frustration at an inability to hold down a regular place under the interim stewardship of Rafael Benítez was made very clear. "I was out for four or five months with the injuries, sitting there watching the lads," he said. "That was difficult to take. So, when you do get your chance, it's more an emphasis on impressing to stay in. But when I was playing well last year, even scoring goals, I didn't maintain my place either. So it was quite frustrating for me.
"I didn't doubt myself. When you are fit, you understand what you can achieve and do. But if you're not getting those chances, it's hard to prove. I've always been sure of myself, ability-wise. But when you have niggles and injuries, it's difficult to maintain that, and impossible when you're in and out of the side. You can't pick up your own form and for people to notice. When I did play I was scoring goals and playing well. But the manager chose the other two [Luiz and Cahill]. That was fine by me. I played a couple of reserve games behind closed doors to maintain my match fitness but I've always been very sure of myself."
He, like Frank Lampard and the absent Ashley Cole â still back at Cobham nursing a rib injury â is an English veteran playing for a new contract beyond the end of this season. The fact he has started every Premier League game to date bodes well. "I'm playing now so hopefully everything else takes care of itself," he said. "We have great belief with the manager back and he instils that in us. Hopefully we can kick on and do well."
Schalke will test their resilience, even if a lengthy injury list is hampering the manager Jens Keller's preparations. He lost his midfielder Max Hoger to a long-term knee injury at the weekend, and the forwards Jefferson Farfán, Klaas-Jan Huntelaar are also out. The first-choice goalkeeper Timo Hildebrand, Jermaine Jones and Kevin-Prince Boateng will all return after proving their fitness but they will be rusty. The 20-year-old was targeted by Arsenal over the summer despite signing a contract in May, a deal that runs through to 2018 and contains a £38m buy-out clause. "It's not time yet to have the calculator and to be counting the number of points you need to qualify or to be first or second or into the Europa League," Mourinho said. "The calculator comes on the fifth fixture, but we've found some balance by winning our last game [in Bucharest]. We play twice now against the strongest opponent in the group, and need points over these two matches. That much is obvious."
