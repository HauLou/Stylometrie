Chelsea's "little horses" have galloped clear of the pack. If that win at Manchester City on Monday had served notice that this team are contenders, despite José Mourinho's protestations to the contrary, then the follow-up was impressive in its slick and efficient delivery. Newcastle may be a side who feel horribly stretched at present but they were dismissed almost at will, their players diminished in the mere presence of Eden Hazard.
The Belgian is irresistible, a world-class talent whose potential to develop further is frightening. Take his second goal, reward plucked at breakneck pace to knock the stuffing from the visitors' challenge, with team-mates having tapped into Hazard's wavelength. Newcastle had actually been mustering at a corner, aspiring to force parity through Moussa Sissoko, when a save by Petr Cech and a heavy touch from Vurnon Anita resulted in the ball squirting out of the area for David Luiz to hook down the left flank, Willian to gather and, eventually, Hazard to collect.
He cut inside, slipped a pass to Samuel Eto'o, who backheeled a return behind a panicked Paul Dummett, and there was Hazard to dart in behind the defender and finish first time with his right foot. Even "Class," was the Newcastle manager's assessment. "His performance here was like that against Hull, at City, at Southampton, at home to United and Liverpool," said Mourinho. "He's basically playing the same way. The only difference was the hat-trick." It was almost as if his plunder was an aside, glitzy decoration for all the skill and effort. "He's playing really well: big evolution; consistency; ambition. Fantastic."
When one witnesses such brilliance, those oft-stated aspirations to emulate Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi do not seem quite so outlandish. "These players are the best on the planet," Hazard had told the BBC earlier in the day. "They score one, two, three goals every game. It's something you've got to aim for."
He did that here, registering the second hat-trick of his career and his first in English football, to swell his tally for the season to 14. Mourinho, having eked industry from such a creative force, has since urged him to be more ruthless. The 23-year-old is taking the advice on board.
He now has six goals in his past eight He was untouchable, tormenting first Mathieu Debuchy and, once the Frenchman had retired with a calf injury, Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa, although he did not scorch just Newcastle's beleaguered right-backs. Centre-halves were pulled out of position and neither Davide Santon nor Anita could cope with his movement. "He has a great platform on which to perform," said Pardew, "with their back four so tough behind him."
The solidity here came in the absence of John Terry, who missed his first Premier League minutes of the season with a muscle twinge. The clean sheet means this team have conceded two goals in their past 11 games, even if Newcastle had been offered glimpses of goal.
Luuk de Jong, on his full debut, almost registered a first club goal since April after peeling away from David Luiz, only for Cech to flop down on the effort in the goalmouth. The goalkeeper would later react smartly to thwart Sissoko, once he had evaded Ivanovic, while both Sammy Ameobi and Sylvain Marveaux missed presentable opportunities late on. Pardew hopes to restore Papiss Cissé to the side against Tottenham Hotspur in midweek, though the Senegalese must rediscover the bite that has eluded him in recent times.
Chelsea always felt comfortable, not least because Newcastle retained their propensity to self-destruct. Yanga-Mbiwa summed that up. Frank Lampard had just seen a free-kick tipped over when the veteran's corner was cleared, only for Howard Webb to be alerted to the defender's wrestling of Eto'o to the floor at the far post. Hazard ambled up for the spot-kick and slid it easily home and Chelsea, with Manchester City scoreless in Norwich, were top. This team had only previously spent 10 days at the summit this season â compared with Arsenal's 130 and City's 24 â and, with West Bromwich Albion awaiting on Tuesday, Mourinho was not quite ready to make his side contenders just yet. "We are playing well, with players in a good moment individually and getting results," he said.
"Now we are top of the league and that is something we cannot hide â but no change." Are his team still "little horses" in a thoroughbred race? "It's time to kill the horses," came the response. The metaphor has run its course.
