At first this all seemed rather familiar. Yet, where he had felt compelled to seek out Scholes last May and engage with a midfielder he had so admired, soaking up any knowledge he could in the process, there will be no attempt at reconciliation this time â particularly, it seems, with Redknapp, who in fairness was rather more glowing of the youngsterâs display against Besiktas in the Champions League qualifiers a week later. âI listen to the people who I work closely with and, with all due respect, if anything Redknapp should have a little bit more, not ârespectâ but âsympathyâ,â said Wilshere. âItâs easy for someone to go on television and say: âHe should be doing this or that.â But, if you look back, he was injured just as much as I was. Maybe more. And he was never injured at my age as well and it does take a lot of mental strength [to come back].
âSo to hear people go on TV and say: âHeâs got to get fitter,â well, I donât need that. I listen to people like the boss here, Gary Neville, people who talk a lot of sense and can help me with my game. It doesnât âhurtâ me, hearing criticism from ex-players. It probably disappoints me a little bit more. I heard what Robbie Savage said and that was, if you like, the first ex-player to give me constructive criticism. I respected that. Iâll take criticism. I know thatâs part and parcel of football. But when itâs just reckless and aggressive, I donât listen.â
Those comments, delivered after Wilshere had been substituted 69 minutes into a game âJack Wilshereâs problem is Jack Wilshere,â Redknapp had said. âHeâs not performing. Heâs got to take games by the scruff of the neck like two years ago. There are no excuses for this young lad any more.â
That is hardly revelatory and the youngsterâs frustration is born of the reality that he does not need reminding of. He is already acutely aware that, after so many false dawns, founded largely in a fragile body, he must take the opportunities ahead for club and country if he is to fulfil his potential.
It will be a considerable challenge for him to hold down a regular place in the Arsenal side once Arsène Wengerâs complement are fully fit and available. âIf something went wrong a couple of years ago I would have gone to the physio: âLook, my ankleâs not right.â Now Iâm on top of it, enjoying my football and Iâve grown up. I realise things arenât going to go my way every week. Of course theyâre not. But the main thing is to give your all and enjoy. Iâve worked with a psychologist at Arsenal and heâs taught me that, if your headâs not right, it can affect other parts of your body. So get that right and enjoy your football, and thatâs what Iâm trying to do. I wouldâve liked to have played over 250 games and, if Iâd been injury-free, I wouldâve. So in that respect Iâm not where I should be. But in terms of dealing with the injuries, adapting and accepting that, Iâm where I want to be.â
In that context photographs of him smoking while on holiday in Las Vegas this summer might have been considered untimely, particularly given he had spoken to Wenger after coverage of a similar incident last season. âIf I smoked 20 a day and scored 20 a season, it wouldnât be a problem,â he said. âIâve been caught a couple of times but Iâm not a regular smoker. Iâm not reckless. I have two kids. I donât want them growing up thinking: âLook at Daddy, he goes out all the time. He smokes.â Iâm not one of âthemâ. Itâs under control. I spoke with the boss after the first time and he was accepting, like âIâm French and Iâve been on a team bus with French players who are smokingâ. And the second time it was: âLook, come on, Jack. This is a big season for you.â I knew that already.
âI went on holiday and enjoyed it but as soon as I came back to pre-season training I said Iâd be fit and I have been. It is an important season for me not just for my country but for my club. Iâve had a good pre-season, the first time in three or four years where Iâve managed to do every single session. Iâve stayed away from injury, trained here every day. Iâm fit and in the gym. Itâs a big season for me. Thereâs no point in me saying: âIâve got another year to develop.â Iâm 22 now. Look at Germany. Mario Götze has won the World Cup and heâs my age. It is time to deliver.â
Wilshere welcomed three World Cup winners back to Arsenal last month in Mesut Özil, Lukas Podolski and Per Mertesacker, with their presence offering constant reminders of what can be achieved through the strength of the collective. âI asked Podolski who their best player was and he said: âWe didnât really have a Cristiano Ronaldo or a Lionel Messi. We were just a good team.â Thatâs what they had. Donât get me wrong: theyâve got world-class players but they work so well as a team and, when up against the Messis and Ronaldos, they came out on top because they worked together.â
Therein probably lies Englandâs best hope of progression, with the development of a selfless, industrious team who play to their strengths. It is a process which will take time, but one in which Wilshere hopes to be integral. âGermany won the World Cup and we went out in the group stages, so thatâs how far we are away from them,â he added. âWe havenât got Messi or Ronaldo but we have good players. The teamâs been broken up a little bit with Lamps and Gerrard going, so weâre trying to work together as a team. Weâre moving in the right direction.â Their progress will be tested in Basel on Monday.
