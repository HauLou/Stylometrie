Somewhere lost amid the din at the final whistle, as the home fans gnashed their teeth in livid frustration and the visitors bellowed their celebratory taunts into the night sky, it was easy to forget that José Mourinho had been proved right. The Chelsea manager had insisted on the eve of this derby that his own team were not yet ready to reclaim the The Portuguese appeared to gain little satisfaction in his judgment effectively being confirmed, as this whole occasion proved utterly exasperating for the majority present. Mourinho fidgeted through the first period and seemed to spend almost the entire second half berating the fourth official once frustration had overcome him, so enraged was he by the "19th-century football" West Ham were apparently playing. If his mood was darkened by perceived time-wasting and stalling tactics, it was actually the visitors' efficient smothering of everything flung at them that drove Chelsea struck the crossbar early on as Oscar curled a shot goalwards and Adrián tipped on to the woodwork, and rattled the post in stoppage time at the end when Demba Ba should probably have converted.
Even Frank Lampard, the kind of player who waltzes on to stages such as this to bring the house down, was denied at the end as he skipped on to Eden Hazard's cross and side-footed goalwards only for Adrián to conjure yet another fine save.
The official statistics had Chelsea down for 39 shots, albeit only nine on target, and 72% of the ball. West Ham apparently had only one attempt all night, a fine downward header from James Tomkins, though they had actually looked threatening on the counter-attack when released from the shackles. Quite how Mourinho would have reacted had Andy Carroll converted rather than air-kicked in front of goal on the hour is anybody's guess.
The visitors' resistance was impressive, particularly given that they had shipped 28 goals in their previous nine games and ended with 10 men after Joey O'Brien dislocated a shoulder.
"Tottenham was our best result, winning there for [the first time in] about 15 years, but this one probably equals it because of the position we're in and the problems we've had to overcome," said Sam Allardyce.
"A fantastically resilient performance. It was all about frustrating a team with world-class players and not to come here and lie down. Tactically we got it right, stopping Hazard, Oscar and Willian. We nullified them, limited them to a few chances, even when we went down to 10 men when we had tired legs and minds."
The point lifted West Ham up to 18th, still below the cut-off but within sight of safety. For Chelsea the frustration was palpable. Mourinho's side travel to the new leaders, Manchester City, on Monday aware that, if they lose at the Etihad, they will be six points off the top. This was a reminder that, against blanket defence, they can still struggle to break down opponents and Mourinho's decision to offer up talk of retrograde tactics smacked of a manager seeking to distract.
It was tempting to wonder how Juan Mata, who has found space in congested occasions in the past, might have fared as Chelsea's relentless battering failed to break West Ham down.
But Mata, of course, has gone and the pace of the pass was not quick enough at times to generate the clearer-cut opportunities Chelsea craved. Mourinho had sprung on to the turf when O'Brien âwhose shoulder was popped back into its socket post-match â clattered through the back of Willian, taking away his standing leg. By then he had tired of the delaying tactics as West Ham clung to what they had, with men behind the ball and the space cramped. Mourinho was asked what other tactics he might have employed to squeeze out a winner.
"The only thing I could use was a Black and Decker [drill] to destroy the wallâ¦" came the riposte. That summed it up.
His gripe would move on to the amount of time added on at the end and a lack of consistency by officials. "The referees aren't consistent and it's the same with the red cards," he said.
"Compare O'Brien's tackle with [Nemanja]Vidic here earlier this month... but I don't want to complain about the referee. Not when we've had a result I didn't want. We go to Manchester City on Monday and are they favourites? Yes.
"Are they favourites to score again four, five or six goals? Yes. But it will start 0-0 and we go there to compete." Presumably that will not mean blanket defence. After this that tactic is off the menu.
