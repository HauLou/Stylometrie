Saturdayâs defeat by Italy which warranted optimism in terms both of the years ahead but also, potentially, of the next week in Brazil. But his mood also bristled in the immediate aftermath of the defeat at the Arena Amazônia, most notably at the suggestion that he had once been guaranteed a place in Roy Hodgsonâs starting lineup but also when the prickly issue of his position reared up.
The Manchester United forward had started the first half in Manaus on the left, began the second period on the right and spent only the latter stages attempting to unsettle through the middle. âI think it was quite clear,â he said when asked what his role had been. âI played on one side initially, then the other after half-time. It was a switch from the manager.â
But does involvement on either flank coax the best from him? âI donât know. I enjoyed the game. I was involved in the match: I could have scored, I created the goal and felt I had an influence even though we lost.â Somewhere beneath the monotone response flickered frustration.
In truth Rooney had drifted in and out of the contest as much as he flitted from flank to flank. If Fifaâs running statistics were an indication of his industry â no This was by no means a lacklustre display, with the man around whom the team once revolved effectively transformed into a workhorse. Neither was it entirely ineffective, one freakishly sliced corner aside. Admittedly there were a few inaccurate attempts thrown in but he created those chances for himself, eking out space from Italyâs back-line. Yet the reality that he contributed only two touches in the Italian penalty area all evening told its own story. He will surely not âenjoyâ this tournament, as he had pledged to do last week, if he is marooned far from goal.
The exasperation served up in some quarters at his performance appeared to be born of the fact he had failed to take this game by the scruff of the neck and dominate in the same jaw-dropping way Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben had done against the Spanish or Alexis Sánchez had against Australia. But at least that trio were playing in positions which suit them best. âThe disappointing thing was not the way Wayne Rooney played but where he was played,â said Paul Scholes in his latest missive for Paddy Power. âI donât blame Wayne one little bit but he was played in three different positions. Heâs without doubt Englandâs best goalscorer but he was played on the left, played on the right, then in the centre. Whereâs the confidence in Wayne to say: âYouâre our main player. Youâre our centre-forward?â If he plays there, he scores goals.â
That much is undeniable. Rooney was Englandâs leading scorer in the qualifying campaign, with seven in six matches, and scored home and away against Poland and Montenegro, two of the more awkward opponents in the section. He has 39 goals from 93 caps, a prolific record to prove that, when utilised close to goal as he was by Fabio Capello, he has tended to thrive. That he has failed to illuminate Englandâs last three appearances at major finals is accepted but, in the context of his record and the threat he is known to carry, does he truly merit merely being shoehorned awkwardly into the lineup? Why would he not be played through the middle?
The simple answer is that Daniel Sturridge merits his inclusion as the lone forward, a player propelled into this tournament by the most productive Premier League campaign of his career and a youngster in whom the national team now trust. His sixth international goal was scored on the half-volley with panache, supplied by Rooneyâs most telling contribution from the flank. The 24-year-old deserves a starting role â his bite and eagerness to rip shots goalwards whenever he can are refreshing â but would his more experienced team-mate not be better suited as the No10, where he can gather, turn and deliver passes to runners all around? He would certainly be likelier to make his own impression in the penalty area from that starting point.
The urgency to tap into his predatory instincts is acknowledged. âOf course, we need him to have more touches in the box,â said Roy Hodgson. âWe want him in the area. But I thought he set up the goal really well with that clever pass. Then, after Leighton Baines put him in, I was convinced he was going to score when he got himself room in the box. But, yes, we want Wayne in the box and thereâs no question we will get him in the box. He certainly worked his socks off for us.â His workrate is not in doubt but where Hodgson had decreed Raheem Sterlingâs pace to be a means of unsettling Andrea Pirlo and Daniele De Rossi, perhaps the Liverpool teenager â such a revelation â may be better utilised more from the wing against Uruguay. That would at least offer Rooney the chance to convert rather than create opportunities.
There will still be occasions to interchange with the sprinters, to allow Sterling or Danny Welbeck to run at Diego Lugano and potentially free up space in which Englandâs most senior forward can thrive. That seems his likeliest route to a first World Cup goal. This is a team that still leans heavily on the handful of players in their number with experience of
