Alan Pardew is poised to become the manager of Crystal Palace although talks are continuing over a compensation package with Pardew declined to attend post-match interviews after Newcastleâs 3-2 home win against Everton on Sunday, so as to avoid the need to discuss the Palace vacancy.
He has since made it clear to the Newcastle owner, Mike Ashley, currently on holiday in Barbados, that he wants to join Palace after growing frustrated at St Jamesâ Park.
Although he is the Premier Leagueâs second longest serving manager at just over four years, Pardew has been severely restricted by the clubâs transfer policy and worn down by a growing campaign by a large section of fans to have him removed.
A deal over compensation, understood to be in the region of £2m, looks like a formality. Talks between Ashley and the Palace co-chairman, Steve Parish, took place on Monday afternoon.
Pardew is one of the lowest paid managers in the league and Palace will at least match his salary. His arrival will probably be followed by a bid for the Swansea striker Bafétimbi Gomis at around £6m. Palace are away to Aston Villa on New Yearâs Day
