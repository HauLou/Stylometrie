Paul Clement has ruled himself out of the vacant managerial position at Queens Park Rangers and reaffirmed his commitment to Real Madrid, paving the way for The highly regarded Clement, who has worked as Carlo Ancelottiâs No2 at Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and now at the Bernabéu, had featured on a three-man shortlist drawn up by the QPR hierarchy as they search for a successor to Harry Redknapp. The third name on the list, Steve McClaren, worked briefly as a coach at QPR last season but is intent on gaining promotion to the Premier League with Derby County and has no interest in the position.
Clement, whose father, Dave, featured in 472 league games for the west London club between 1965 and 1979, is forging a fine reputation within the game having coached some of the best players in the world over the past few years, helping to win domestic trophies in England, France and Spain as well as last seasonâs European Cup, and does aspire to manage in the future in his homeland.

His candidacy is being championed by Les Ferdinand, who was promoted to director of football on Wednesday and will wield a considerable influence in the appointment of Redknappâs successor. The pair worked closely together at White Hart Lane last season.
No permanent appointment is expected before the weekend when Kevin Bond and Chris Ramsey will take charge of the team for Saturdayâs game against Southampton, with input from Ferdinand in the standsas QPR seek a first win in eight games. Both Joe Jordan and Glenn Hoddle have left Loftus Road this week in the wake of Redknappâs resignation.
