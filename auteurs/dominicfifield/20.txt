The town of Chantilly in northern France has emerged as a leading contender to host Englandâs training base during next summerâs European Championship as the Football Association continues its preparations for the tournament in anticipation of the teamâs qualification.
Roy Hodgsonâs side have a pristine record in Group E, their winning run having been extended to six games with Sundayâs 3-2 success at third-placed Slovenia, and can in effect secure a place at Competition is fierce to secure the best locations given there will be 24 nations at the expanded tournament. Having initially been attracted to the idea of being based at one of the three venues around Montpellier on the south coast or another in Brittany, the FA is giving serious consideration to Chantilly, not least because of its obvious logistical benefits.
The town of 11,000 inhabitants, in the Picardy region of northern France and famous for its racecourse, is 30 miles north of Paris and within easy striking distance of the Stade de France and Parc des Princes in the capital, plus Lille and Lens to the north-east. Furthermore, it is only 25 minutesâ drive from Charles de Gaulle airport.

Euro 2016 will feature games at 10 venues, with the others being Marseille, Nice and Toulouse in the south, Lyon and Saint-Etienne centrally, and Bordeaux in the south-west.
The base would see the team stay at the Auberge du Jeu de Paume, a luxury hotel with 92 rooms and suites, two restaurants, the two-star Michelin chef Arnaud Faye and an extensive spa and gym, all a stoneâs throw from the Château de Chantilly and the racecourse.
In Chantilly the team would train at the Stade des Bourgognes, which has six pitches and is home to the townâs amateur side. Spain trained there at the 1998 World Cup.
National associations whose teams qualify for Euro 2016 have until 31 January to confirm their venue with Uefa.
