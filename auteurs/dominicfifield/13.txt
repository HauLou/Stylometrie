Stoke Cityâs hopes of securing Victor Moses from Moses spent last season in the Potteries, scoring four times in 23 games and impressing in flashes, before suffering a hamstring injury in April which ended his season prematurely. The 24-year-old had enjoyed a similar season-long switch to Liverpool the previous year, only to find his opportunities more limited at Anfield, and had been expected to seek a fresh start from Chelsea during the summer window with the prospect of regular first-team involvement with the champions relatively remote.

The Stoke manager, Mark Hughes, had identified the former Crystal Palace trainee, whom Chelsea secured for £9m from Wigan in 2012, as a priority signing ahead of the new campaign and are considering stipulating the winger must be part of any proposed deal for Begovic. However, Moses, who boasts 24 caps for Nigeria, is understood to be unsure over a return to City and is instead considering a number of other options, both in the Premier League and abroad.
Chelseaâs interest in Begovic, who is entering the final year of his contract, will be maintained regardless as the Premier League winners aim to secure a replacement for Petr Cech, who is expected to complete a move to Arsenal.
The Bosnia international, who would cost around £8m, will seek assurances he is not merely being signed as an understudy for Thibaut Courtois and will be offered senior involvement. The likes of Rob Green, at QPR, and the Getafe goalkeeper, Vicente Guaita, have also been considered this summer.
