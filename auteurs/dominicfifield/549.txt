The Dutch Football Federation has launched an investigation into the ownership structure of Vitesse Arnhem after the former major shareholder alleged Chelsea had exerted undue influence at the The Premier League club and Vitesse enjoy a close relationship, with the Dutch team's owner, Alexander Chigirinsky, a good friend of A bitter dispute has recently flared up between the former owner Merab Jordania and Chigirinsky, with the former suggesting Chelsea have dismissed Jordania's allegations and insist "I want to tell the Vitesse supporters the real story," said Jordania, a former Georgian footballer who saved Vitesse from financial ruin in 2010. "I wanted to reach for the title, but 'London' didn't want that in the end. Ambition is fine, but Vitesse is not allowed to reach the Champions League â¦ I will tell you now why [the manager] Fred Rutten left [last June]. He knew that he wasn't allowed to win the title with Vitesse.
"In the winter he brought the team to the top. We had the feeling we needed one more player to win the title, Kelvin Leerdam. The transfer seemed to be a done deal when all of a sudden 'London' intervened. We were not allowed to be too strong. I couldn't explain that to Fred. I had to cover the club and 'London', but it caused a lot of tension and chaos."
Jordania also claimed the sale of Wilfried Bony to Swansea last summer was sanctioned to prevent Vitesse qualifying for the Champions League. "I wanted to keep Bony in Arnhem for six more months," he said. "I was in touch with Michael Laudrup, the Swansea manager at the time. I told him it was better that he took Bony in the winter, for Vitesse to start strong in the season, but Bony had to be sold."
The Vitesse chairman, Bert Roetert, claimed Jordania's comments read like "a poor 1 April joke".
