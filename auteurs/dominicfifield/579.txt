Tottenham Hotspur will have Younès Kaboul available for Sunday's north London derby against Arsenal after an independent regulatory commission, appointed by the Football Association, upheld the club's claim of wrongful dismissal for the Frenchman's sending off against Chelsea on Sunday.
The referee, Michael Oliver, had shown the centre-half a red card for his role in an apparent tangle with Samuel Eto'o in the penalty area just before the hour. The Cameroonian, who had just put the hosts ahead, was in front of goal and appeared likely to convert Eden Hazard's cross at the time, with Kaboul, despite contact appearing minimal, deemed by the officials to have denied an obvious goalscoring opportunity.
Spurs, who lost Dawson to a hamstring injury later in the game and are already without the Romania centre-half Vlad Chiriches and even the back-up Étienne Capoue, were infuriated by the decision and appealed against the dismissal with their options in the middle of their defence severely depleted before the north London derby. They also take on Benfica in the first leg of their last 16 Europa League tie at White Hart Lane on Thursday.
A regulatory commission scrutinised the incident and determined that Dawson was close enough to Eto'o as the striker reached Hazard's pass to cast doubt over whether the goalscoring opportunity was actually "obvious". Indeed Eto'o's touch, under pressure from Kaboul, took the ball back towards Dawson, with that enough to persuade them to rescind the red card. The decision to award the penalty in the first place was not under consideration.
The let-off will allow Kaboul, whose campaign has been limited to 11 appearances due to ankle and knee injuries, to partner Jan Vertonghen at the heart of Spurs' defence against Stoke, meanwhile, have lost an appeal against Jonathan Walters' red card in the 1-1 draw at Norwich on Saturday. The striker was dismissed for a foul on Alexander Tettey and must serve a three-match suspension.
