José Mourinho is to contest a misconduct charge stemming from his comments following Chelsea's surprise home defeat by Sunderland this month, with the manager having requested a non-personal hearing.
The Football Association had deemed Mourinho's apparently sarcastic assessment of the performances of the referee, Mike Dean, and Mike Riley, general manager of Professional Game Match Officials Limited, to have constituted improper conduct and to have brought the game into disrepute.
Mourinho, who is in the process of appealing against an £8,000 fine after being sent to the stands for re-entering the playing area at Aston Villa, had complained last week at the lack of humour in the FA's response, reiterating: "I told the referee he was amazing, and I repeat: he was amazing."
The assistant first-team coach, Rui Faria, has admitted two misconduct breaches after his livid reaction to Dean's award of Sunderland's decisive penalty eight minutes from time. He used abusive and/or insulting words towards the fourth official, Phil Dowd, and then accrued a second charge for his behaviour following the referee's request to leave the technical area. He, too, has requested a non-personal hearing, so has to submit mitigating evidence â principally that he has no previous offences to his name â in the hope that it is taken into account when determining his sanction.
His punishment could range from a touchline ban to a suspension from the stadium on matchdays. Mourinho is more likely to incur a third fine of the season from the FA, if found guilty, with the governing body now to set a date when both hearings will take place in front of an independent regulatory commission. The Brazil midfielder Ramires admitted a violent conduct charge last week from the same game and was banned retrospectively for four games after swinging his arm at Sebastian Larsson just before half-time.
