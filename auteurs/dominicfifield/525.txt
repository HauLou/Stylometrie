Questions lobbed from the floor were dismissed abruptly, the curt responses covering topics from weakened selections at Anfield on Sunday, via David Moyes's sacking at Manchester United, to his own coded suggestion last month that Luis Suárez should be considered "King of Penalties". The answers were hardly more effusive for the written media, even if flashes of a smile offered fleeting reminders of the self-styled Happy One of last summer. The second FA charge, for his assessment of Mike Dean's display last Saturday and his appraisal of Mike Riley's performance as head of elite refereeing, did crop up. "I told the referee he was amazing, and I repeat: he was amazing," he said. He was aware of an Englishman's penchant for a spot of sarcasm, presumably? "So Mr Bean is in jail â¦"
That was an insight into his frustration at the authorities' rather humourless take on those post-match comments, but it was about the best of the soundbites offered up, with the same brevity of response delivered even when it came to his protege making good. What of Theirs is the subplot to Sunday's thunderous collision on Merseyside, a meeting of master and apprentice, the younger man on the verge of something remarkable and his mentor, if only privately, intent upon reminding all comers that experience still counts. Their friendship stretches back to the summer of 2004, when Mourinho arrived from Porto and sought a like-minded coach to play a major role in his academy. Rodgers was highly regarded at Reading, who had played Mourinho recognised ambition and potential, someone who could implement the favoured 4-3-3 or 4-4-2 diamond through the club's youth ranks, and a coach 10 years his junior who, like him, had endured an inauspicious playing career. "I had a vision and philosophy well in place, and I was asked to go to Chelsea to implement that," Rodgers said. "They saw me as someone with a European philosophy: I always saw it as a fusion between European football and British mentality. José didn't have the protection of being a big player to get his opportunity. He had to go down a different route and he gave me the confidence you can become a leader in your field by doing that. Our ideas on football weren't exactly the same, but I saw how he dealt with players, how he gained their respect, and I learned."
Rodgers has likened his three and a half years under Mourinho to "being at Harvard University", and the fact he sought advice from the Portuguese before taking on the Liverpool job in 2012 is a reflection of respect. Yet Mourinho, when urging the younger man to take on the challenge via text, could not have supposed his impact would be this rapid. After all, towards the end of that year, he had decreed from Madrid that Rodgers "cannot make miracles" with the resources at his disposal at Anfield. "Brendan can't be a champion with that team," he had said. Now, with Daniel Sturridge, Simon Mignolet and Philippe Coutinho added and excelling, Rodgers' The intrigue lies in what happens to the pair's friendship from now on in, with each in charge of a team in contention. Mourinho has seen other members of his entourage progress and establish themselves as managers in their own right. Steve Clarke and Aitor Karanka have taken on roles, with West Bromwich Albion and Middlesbrough, though neither posed a threat to their mentor in terms of title races or silverware. His relations with André Villas-Boas became somewhat more strained, his scout having flown the nest prematurely to pursue a similar progression elsewhere â Académica to Porto back home and, most eye-catchingly, to Stamford Bridge â and, at the time, his Tottenham Hotspur had appeared to pose a threat last summer. Their friendship was probably wrecked already, but it was never likely to be repaired in direct opposition. The danger here is that, while Rodgers and Mourinho still appear close, could they not be consumed by the intensity of the rivalry being rekindled between Liverpool and Chelsea? Will the enmity to be whipped up between the clubs allow it?
It did for any respect once enjoyed by Rafael Benítez and Mourinho during the latter's first spell in England. The Spaniard has recalled an amicable conversation shared on the stairs at Anfield after Chelsea's 1-0 Premier League victory on New Year's Day in 2005, a result which left the London club top and 18 points clear of sixth-placed Liverpool. Their menace was distant. Then came the League Cup final and, most explosively of all, the Champions League semi-finals, complete with Mourinho's 'ghost goal', in April. "Our 'good' relationship was over," wrote Benítez in his autobiography. "He had identified us as a team who could stop him achieving all that he wanted. There would be no more courtesy between Anfield and Stamford Bridge."
Rodgers was ensconced at Cobham by then and appreciates the level of antipathy between supporters. "Maybe it was made to be the managers, and that was the rivalry, but I am a different person," he said. "For me there is no drama, no issue with him. The advantage I have is I know José behind the manager: a man who is humble, respectful, has real good values and ethics, but he is a winner and he wants to win. You will have seen over the years his reaction to losing. Managers are different and we all deal with pressure in different ways but I have never thought it would fracture [our friendship] because I never get personal. This is about my job, my club, and I protect Liverpool."
Even last December, when Chelsea overcame Liverpool at Stamford Bridge, accepted wisdom was Rodgers' team may struggle to sustain their challenge to the season's finale. Their charge over this calendar year has provoked regular reminders from Mourinho that Liverpool benefit without the onerous demands of European football disrupting their own schedule and stretching squad resources. Regardless of events on Sunday, next season will pose a new challenge for Rodgers, though all will recognise the quality his team possess. That will place its own strain on the friendship between those in the dugouts. For now, feeling gagged by the FA and undermined by the Premier League, Mourinho has other issues to darken his mood.
