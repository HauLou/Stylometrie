Roy Hodgson has urged Neville has played a hands-on role over the past month, from Portugal to Florida to Rio, and his influence within the Nevilleâs influence and standing in the game makes him a candidate to succeed Hodgson post-Euro 2016, though a lack of managerial experience might count against him. âThe first thing Iâd say to him is donât be in too much of a rush to do anything,â said Hodgson when asked whether he would encourage Neville to cut back his punditry duties and seek a full-time coaching role. âHaving a long career in football gets harder and harder. The number of jobs available vis-a-vis the amount of time people spend in those jobs gets less and less, so I certainly wouldnât advise him necessarily to jump at the first opportunity to do coaching or management.
âThe longer he can combine the two roles the better. Heâs learning a lot in the environment with us, working with more experienced coaches and top players, and thatâs beneficial to him. Heâs doing a very good job on the television. So my advice would be to keep it going for as long as he feels he wants to keep it going. I donât have any doubt in my mind that he will become a top-class coach and a top-class manager. Itâs just a question of when he decides to leave the punditry behind and go in to the job of working with players. He likes working with players and heâs good at it.â
Hodgson was asked whether Neville, who was capped 85 times over a 12-year England career, has the attributes required to take on the managerâs role. âThatâs a bit unfair to suggest,â he said. âOf course he can be. Anyone can be an England manager. Weâve had that before. Itâs not necessarily a role that has anything other than the FA deciding, has this man got the qualities we are looking for, or not? Thatâs what an England manager is. But it would be wrong to start putting him under pressure to suggest âyou need to get down to some work in a club side because the England managerâs job is there waiting for youâ. Who knows? When the job comes up again, who knows what candidates there will be?â
