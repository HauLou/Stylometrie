Once he had steered the conversation away from all things Pep, Real and Barça, José Mourinho showed a certain enthusiasm for the Mourinho is acting as educator these days, his frequent reminders this is a young squad â certainly when compared to Bayern Munich's seasoned champions â serving to underline the long-term nature of the project he has assumed at Stamford Bridge second time round. That many of this team were at the club when Roberto Di Matteo's side oversaw victory in the elite competition at the Allianz Arena in 2012 hardly matters. This is about readjusting after last season's success in the lesser competition: a wake-up call before the confrontations with Schalke, Basel and Steaua Bucharest to come, even if the last two of their Champions League group opponents were actually beaten en route to the lesser trophy last season.
All concerned would like to deliver a statement of intent in Prague. They will both surely play a part against Bayern. Samuel Eto'o, now signed from Anzhi Makhachkala on a one-year contract, and Willian are not in the Czech Republic but Juan Mata, who has been relatively under-used to date, will hope to start with Mourinho reaffirming he remains integral at the club. "He didn't play at Manchester United but I always have my reasons, and I have a duty to explain them to the players," he said. "That I did. We have no problem. He's a very important player for us, I want him to stay, he wants to stay."
David Luiz trained on Thursday night but he may be limited to a cameo role after hamstring trouble in a match that will test Chelsea's credentials. Bayern are under new management and "Bayern's strength is the team," said Mourinho. "The team is made up of end products, a team of players in the best moment of their careers. I guess their average age is 27 or 28, all very experienced, all year after year in the best competitions, not just with the club but the national team. They come from a season when they showed they were the perfect team, because only perfect teams can win the treble. So that's their best quality: this incredible footballistic power, the personality they have, and as end products they are fantastic."
And, for all the Chelsea manager's attempts to deflect the subject, it will eventually come back to a duel between Mourinho and Guardiola. Chelsea had twice courted the Spaniard, immediately after Di Matteo's Champions League triumph and once they had lost faith in the Italian at the start of last season, but had been unable to convince him to come to London. Regardless, the former Barça manager hopes to coach in the Premier League at some stage. "I'd like to live that experience, but in a few years yet. Chelsea have a super trainer now. And Bayern do, too."
