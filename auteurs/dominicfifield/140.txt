José Mourinho has claimed Graeme Souness is âa frustrated manâ and accused him and The sight of nine of the London clubâs outfield players crowding around the referee, Bjorn Kuipers, following Zlatan Ibrahimovicâs challenge on Oscar had been branded âdisgracefulâ by Carragher in his capacity as a pundit for Sky.
Souness, sitting at his side in the studio at Stamford Bridge, was equally scathing and described the conduct as âpatheticâ while praising PSG as âa proper teamâ for standing up to their hosts. Yet Mourinho reacted with incredulity at those comments. âYou know the world is a bit strange,â he said.
âMaybe because of diet and maybe the quality of the products we are eating, but memories are getting shorter. Because, you know, when Jamie Carragher and âMr Souness also, but he stopped playing a long time ago. I coached Benfica after he left there so I know a lot about him, so much about him. But I have had a certain kind of education, not just in football but in life, and I prefer to laugh. Envy is the biggest tribute that the shadows do to the man. Itâs about life.â

Asked to elaborate on the clear friction which exists between him and Souness, Mourinho explained: âThe difference between me and Souness is this. Souness as a player, up there [holds his hand above his head]. José as a player, down there [lowers it again]. But José as a manager, up there. Souness as a manager, down there.With another difference. I was not a frustrated man because I was not a top player. He is clearly a frustrated man. A fantastic player, and I have lots of respect, in spite of some episodes, for a fantastic player with a fantastic career in a fantastic club with a top generation of players. Lots of respect.â
Mourinhoâs relationship with Skyâs punditry team has been spiky at times this season, particularly over the coverage of Diego Costaâs performance against Liverpool in the second leg of the Capital One Cup semi-finals. He had singled out Jamie Redknapp at the time and, while peace appeared to have been brokered with a performance on the networkâs Goals on Sunday show, the comments in midweek have left the situation frosty once again.
The manager offered a strong defence of his playersâ general conduct by pointing out Ibrahimovic had suggested the home players had behaved âlike 11 babiesâ seeking to have him sent off following his challenge on Oscar, but the Chelsea manager rejected that criticism. If they surround the referee [in the Premier League] we are charged and we have to pay a fine, and if we do that the players pay the fine,â said Mourinho, whose team were fined £30,000 by the Football Association for that incident against Everton.
âWe have, in this moment I think, had eight or nine months of competition and we were charged once. We paid for that. Itâs as simple as that. Go to the Premier League and see how many teams were charged and how many times. Chelsea were charged once. Against PSG the game finished and one by one â not just the players but the coaches from PSG â I shook their hands. I told them they deserved it. This was the way we behave after a defeat.
âThis is the example my players get after a defeat. I went to my dressing room, I put everybody together because I am normally very calm and think people deserve to go home and reflect before they speak so as to be without any doubt or emotion, this is what we did.â
