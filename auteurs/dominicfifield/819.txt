Dyke, who admitted last week that no one "realistically" believes England top Group H going into Tuesday's daunting fixture having thumped Moldova at Wembley, though there is an acceptance within the national set-up that the team must emerge unscathed from the trip to the Ukraine if they are to retain control of their own destiny in the section. The hosts have won four matches in succession in the group and hover a point behind Hodgson's team in third, with a home match against Poland and a trip to San Marino, who they defeated 9-0 on Friday, still to play after England's visit.
"No one needs to highlight that Ukraine are an extremely good side," said Sir Trevor Brooking, the FA's director of football development. "They're getting better. We've got to go there but we must not lose because I am pretty sure they will win their last two games and they would then top the group [if they beat England]. We've got to draw or win. It is one of those crunch games, so it's good that we go into on the back of a good performance."
