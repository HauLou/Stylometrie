José Mourinho had long championed Terry's case to remain at the club, for whom he has played since he was 14, after a resurgent campaign at the heart of the defence. Yet negotiations with the 33-year-old's representatives had appeared to stall recently with the player in the dark over where he would be playing his football next term as he, Ashley Cole and Frank Lampard all saluted the crowd on a lap of appreciation following the final home game, against Norwich.
However, talks resumed late last week, with Terry signing a 12-month contract on Monday evening. "I'm delighted to have signed an extension to my contract with Chelsea's recently adopted club policy is to offer one-year deals to players in their 30s upon the expiry of current agreements and while the player had initially been asking for a two-year commitment, he has accepted a shorter arrangement on terms similar to the £175,000-a-week he currently earns. That will leave him as one of the best paid defenders in the top-flight.
Chelsea's chief executive, Ron Gourlay, added: "We are very pleased John, who is an undoubted Chelsea legend, will continue to lead the team next season, as he has done for so many years with unrivalled achievement.
"Both Chelsea and John have been clear throughout that we wanted his outstanding career at the club to continue and it is important the matter has been concluded so soon after the end of the season, allowing us to look forward to and plan for 2014-15."
Terry, such a peripheral figure when hampered by injury under the interim stewardship of Rafael Benítez the previous season, has revived under Mourinho and started 34 A similar arrangement is close to being signed with Lampard, though it remains to be seen whether Mourinho's desire also to retain Cole is recognised by the club's board. The London club are close to securing the signing of Diego Costa from Atlético Madrid, and may then sanction David Luiz's long-mooted departure to Barcelona for around £30m, a transfer that will grant the manager some leeway to operate in the market while complying with financial fair-play regulations.
