The Football Association is to contact QPR and Chelsea for their observations after the visiting players were showered by objects thrown from the stands in the wake of Cesc Fàbregasâs late winner in Sundayâs west London derby at Loftus Road.
Branislav Ivanovic was struck on the neck by a cigarette lighter, with Nemanja Matic also hit as coins and plastic bottles rained down from those supporters seated in the corner of the Loftus Road and Ellerslie Road stands. The FA is awaiting the match officialsâ report but will seek evidence that QPR have begun the process of pinpointing those who flung the objects, having condemned the actions of the small number of fans involved. âThe club is aware that objects were thrown by a small section of supporters towards the pitch following Chelseaâs 88th-minute goal,â said a spokesman. âThe club takes the safety of all supporters and players very seriously and are currently reviewing CCTV footage of the aftermath of the goal in an attempt to identify those responsible.
âWhilst we understand that passions run high during derby fixtures, this is not the kind of behaviour the club condones in any way, shape or form. We take a zero tolerance approach to this sort of behaviour and, if the perpetrators are identified, they will be banned indefinitely from the stadium and, where appropriate, we will liaise with the Metropolitan Police. The club are awaiting communication from the FA following the refereeâs report and will work closely with them in ensuring something like this does not happen again.
âWe would also appeal to fans with any information regarding yesterdayâs incident to contact the club, as we feel itâs necessary to identify the perpetrators as soon as possible, as we believe they are not a true representation of the QPR fanbase.â
