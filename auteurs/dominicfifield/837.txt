José Mourinho has undermined his attempts to brush off Friday's renewal of hostilities with At the pre-match press duties at the Eden Arena, an agitated Mourinho, preparing for the "Your statistics are wrong as a start," he snapped back. "Very wrong, very wrong but I don't want to discuss that because it's not important. I'll just say it's wrong. Go there and see what happened with Inter in the Champions League semi-final. The league records in Spain, the Copa del Rey in Spain, the Super Cup in Spain. You are very, very wrong. You are wrong but it's not important. It's not me against him, it's club against club That's not important."
That prompted a spluttered apology from the inquisitor, who was brandishing Uefa's statistical pack, which did, indeed, detail the 15 meetings between the managers, with Mourinho having won three times, Guardiola seven and five other matches drawn.

He rightly acknowledged that neither manager had played a part in securing the European Cup and Europa League that offered these clubs a chance of early season silverware.
Pointing to the badge on his white training top, the manager said: "It's white but it's Chelsea. If you want questions about Chelsea I'm here until four o'clock. If you want questions about Real Madrid and Barcelona, I'm not here. It's not about me and Pep. It's about Chelsea and
