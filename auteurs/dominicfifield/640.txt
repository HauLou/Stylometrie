Branislav Ivanovic has likened Chelsea's latest signing, Mohamed Salah, to Arjen Robben, having suffered at the hands of the Egypt winger's searing pace in the London club's recent European brushes with Basel.
Salah, who scored three goals in his four Champions League and Europa League meetings with The 21-year-old had unsettled both Ashley Cole and Ivanovic as Basel won both their group games against Chelsea, his burst beyond the Serb to score the only goal in Switzerland in November having briefly given the hosts hope of qualifying for the knockout stage.
"With the ball he is very quick, very smart with his movement, the kind of player that we need in the squad," Ivanovic said of his new team-mate. "He reminds me of Robben, the way he plays always going from the right wing but going inside left-footed. He is a great player, one we know because we've played against him in the last two years. He is young and has time and it's maybe good for him to step up. I hope he is going to be important for us."
The Serbia international welcomed his compatriot Nemanja Matic's impressive full debut for Chelsea in Sunday's FA Cup fourth-round victory over Stoke City â the midfielder's four previous appearances, including his previous spell with the club, had been as a substitute â with his assured display offering a taster of the £20.75m signing's capabilities. "He can still improve a lot but he has improved massively from the last time he was here," Ivanovic said. "Nemanja asks for the ball, goes forward but can also play defensively.
"His future is here and, step by step, he'll become important for us. He has a different confidence now after two great years in Portugal, with a different attitude. He is now a proper player. He came back bigger and stronger. This comes when you play every game, and you feel confidence, and you have the motivation to improve. This happened to him. He was my best mate the last time he was here. Now, for me, he is like my brother. It is a pleasure to have him here."
