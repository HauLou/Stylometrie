Juan Mata will have an opportunity to demonstrate he is worthy of greater involvement in the Chelsea first team when the Spain international begins Tuesday's The selection of an entirely different line-up to that which defeated Fulham on Saturday represents a change in policy by the Portuguese, who had targeted this competition as a means of instilling a winning culture at Stamford Bridge during his first spell at the club. With his priorities slightly different this time, set as he is upon instigating a new style of play, Mourinho will pick the likes of Mata, David Luiz and César Azpilicueta in the hope they impress and stake a claim for more game-time in the Premier League.
"Naturally I have to make some changes and wait for some players to say: 'I am your first choice â compulsory,'" said Mourinho, who will also hand Ryan Bertrand, Michael Essien and, potentially, Tomas Kalas starts against their League One opponents. "Some of the others, when they don't have strong effective performances, it's normal we have some doubts. This is the process. Against Mata, who has started only twice this season, will begin as the side's designated No10 despite losing that place to Oscar â who, along with Saturday's other starters, has enjoyed two days off â in Mourinho's strongest line-up this term. The Spaniard has spoken to the manager and indicated a desire to work hard to regain the role he has played so impressively over his two full seasons at the club. "He knows the score," said the assistant first-team coach, Steve Holland. "He's a top professional footballer with a fantastic attitude. José has his own way [of doing things] but his attention to detail is second to none. He's pushing daily, pushing the players to the maximum, and that's evident not just in his team but in the individuals he's worked with and improved in the past. If you look at the three years Cristiano Ronaldo worked under José, he's evolved as an individual. He's not just a dribbler, but a top-level match-winner who can run in behind and threaten the goal. That comes with pushing, even pushing the best. Whether it's David, Frank [Lampard], Juan, Fernando [Torres] or Ashley [Cole], José will be pushing and looking for signs of improvement for the benefit of the team."
Mourinho won the League Cup twice in his three full seasons at Stamford Bridge first time round, with the trophy the first he celebrated after beating Liverpool in 2005. In his opening game in the competition that season Joe Cole, William Gallas, Arjen Robben and the recently signed Ricardo Carvalho and Paulo Ferreira started against West Ham. The emphasis will be on the fringe players this time with Kalas, 20 and recovered from a broken foot, and Mark Schwarzer set for their first competitive appearances while Willian, Kevin de Bruyne and Marco van Ginkel also seek to make a favourable impression.
