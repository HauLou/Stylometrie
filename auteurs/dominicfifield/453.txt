Danny Welbeckâs participation in Englandâs opening Welbeck, who was already wearing heavy strapping on his right thigh, was led away for treatment by the head physio, Gary Lewin, while the players undertook attacking drills at their plush base at the Urca military camp. His absence from Saturdayâs game would constitute a considerable blow for The 23-year-old, who has scored a solitary goal for club and country since 11 January, has found the net eight times in 20 games under Hodgson, including five in 12 competitive contests for the manager, and he had been pencilled in to operate on the left of an attacking trident â deployed behind Daniel Sturridge â after a relatively impressive display in the goalless friendly draw with Honduras in Miami on Saturday. His pace and willingness to work in defensive areas are valued by Hodgson.
Sterling was heavily involved in Tuesdayâs session, employed for long periods in the central role of the trident just behind Sturridge, with Wayne Rooney, Adam Lallana and James Milner interchanging in the wider positions. He would have started Saturdayâs draw at the Sun Life stadium , most likely in the centre, only to be ruled out through suspension having been sent off against Ecuador in midweek only 13 minutes into his fourth cap for a reckless challenge on Antonio Valencia.
The Liverpool player has had only 39 minutes of football in the past month, though Hodgson would have no qualms about handing him a competitive start against the âIf I select him, it wonât be in my opinion a risk that he hasnât played so many minutes. And if I donât select him, it certainly wonât be because he has only played 39 minutes. It will be because I prefer someone else. Thatâs all I can tell you.â
Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who damaged the medial ligaments in his right knee during the 2-2 draw with Ecuador, was again at the training ground maintaining his fitness with a view to being available for Englandâs second group game against Uruguay in São Paulo. The Arsenal winger was not wearing a brace on the knee as he again undertook running drills. Hodgson does not intend to call up either John Stones or Jon Flanagan to replace the midfielder. âIt looks very unlikely that weâll replace Alex,â he said.
