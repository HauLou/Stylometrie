Campbell, 26, was earning £32,000 a week at Cardiff though those wages came down significantly following relegation back to the Championship after only one season in the top flight.
The former Manchester United trainee scored six league goals last season and, while he had been offered a new contractby Cardiff, he had also attracted interest from promoted Leicester City, who were the first club to trigger the clause in his deal. However, they were unable to agree personal terms and have since turned their focus elsewhere.
Palace have maintained their interest in the Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson, who has been told he can leave for around £8m. To date the only senior addition to Tony Pulisâs ranks at Selhurst Park has been Marouane Chamakh, who signed a two-year contract on Friday having spent last season on a short-term deal at the club.
