Arjen Robben has insisted he was merely being honest by admitting he had gone to ground too easily in an incident during the first half of Hollandâs The Bayern Munich player had won a decisive penalty in added time at the end of the last-16 tie, scored by Klaas-Jan Huntelaar to complete a dramatic turnaround and earn a quarter-final against Costa Rica, with That admission of a dive, albeit in an incident that had not affected the result of the game, had potentially left him open to a Fifa charge but the governing body confirmed it would take retrospective action only over âserious infringementsâ of fair-play rules. Diving would carry only a yellow-card sanction.
âItâs a shame because, yesterday, in an interview after the game I was very honest,â said Robben. âMaybe sometimes you are punished for honesty. But I prefer to be honest. I said there was one foul in the first half where I went to the ground because I thought [the opponent] was going to tackle me, but he took his leg away at the last moment and I went to ground without a touch.
âIt was a stupid action from me but it had no influence on the game. In the first half we should have had a penalty and the one at the end was a clear foul and a penalty. That should be the end of the discussion. I like to be honest. I apologise for this action in the first half but this is football.
âIt had nothing to do with the result of the game. So I apologise for one stupid action but it didnât have an influence in the game. We had two clear penalties, one given. That was it. Now we should move on.â
Fifa, in a statement, opted to remind all participants of the need to maintain the spirit of fair play in the wake of the Robben incident. âSimulation is not something we want to see on the field of play but the referees are trained to identify these simulations and punish them by showing yellow cards,â said Delia Fischer, Fifaâs head of media in Rio de Janeiro.
Robben, asked whether he had been concerned that there might be a sanction imposed by Fifa, said: âAfraid? No, not at all. Why? No. Iâm an honest guy. It had no influence on the game. It was a deserved win and weâre very happy.â
The former Chelsea and Real Madrid forward has been in startling form in Brazil, his searing run beyond Sergio Ramos in Hollandâs 5-1 opening group win over the defending champions, Spain, having set an upbeat tone which has since been maintained. âIâm getting older and, sometimes, that means your game goes down, but I feel better and better,â he said.
âPhysically, Iâm feeling well. Maybe itâs because Iâve been fit for a longer period now, 100% fit, and I could continue this form at the World Cup. Iâm enjoying my game. I have the strength, I have the power, to get away from my opponents. I feel well. Iâm enjoying the World Cup at the moment.â
Costa Rica, winners of a group also comprised of three former winners in Uruguay, Italy and England, await âWe have a chance [of winning the World Cup]. We are in the last eight and doing well. We have a lot of confidence at the moment in the team. It was a big loss losing Nigel de Jong to injury yesterday but our strength at this World Cup has been that every player who has come off the bench has had a big influence on the game. Everyone is very sharp and can come in and take a place.â
