José Mourinho's selection policy hardly suggested a manager affected by all those accusations of bus parking and perceived defensive mind-sets which had delivered a week of impressive results . There were six natural defenders in his team, which might normally have signalled the Portuguese sticking two fingers up at his critics, though his justification was perfectly plausible. "We've lost [Frank] Lampard and Mikel [John Obi] to suspension, so we don't have the players who give us stability in midfield, and I need a compact team," he had said. César Azpilicueta was working tirelessly from the right, everand eager to clog up the centre if required, while Ashley Cole sought to maintain his personal revival. The idea was to keep the contest tight for at least at hour and then, if required, become more expansive against tiring limbs, yet the hosts were not cautious. They still committed forward eagerly. Buses were in vogue in the capital given the three-day Tube strike, but none were in evidence here.
Fernando Torres answered that just after the half-hour. The former Atlético Madrid forward, a teenage captain back at Vicente Calderón whose name had been sung with such affection by the visiting fans prior to kick-off, had been galvanised from the outset, all aggressive running down the channels. Then, with the game so tense, he capitalised on excellent work from Willian and Azpilicueta down the right to dart into space and fizz a first-time shot which flicked from Mario Suárez and bulged the net. "During his period in the club he had moments, and some of them important moments," Mourinho had said after omitting the forward from his lineup at Paris Saint-Germain. "In spite of his not scoring a lot during his career at The visitors' threat had reared whenever Koke lined up a free-kick, the 22-year-old drifting one cross directly on to the bar early on, but their response to falling behind was swift and impressive. Chelsea could spy culpability in Eden Hazard's failure to track Juanfran, and in the indecision which gripped John Terry â on his 100th The other subplot around this tie had been Courtois, the young Belgian goalkeeper on Chelsea's books who has never represented the club having spent his time since leaving Genk on loan at Atlético. The first sighting at "home" had been the 21-year-old striding into the away dressing room, his thoughts lost beneath colossal headphones, with a smattering of boos greeting him from the home support when he emerged for the warm-up. The deflection at Torres's goal left him helpless, but the save down to his left to deny Terry's header showed his quality and frustrated the hosts' attempts to reestablish a lead. His reaction to palm the loose ball away after David Luiz had struck the bar was just as smart. Mark Schwarzer at the other end was the oldest player to start a Champions League knockout tie, at 41 years, 206 days. This was a timely glimpse of the future.
Mourinho could argue his team's achievement in reaching this stage was impressive given the lack of a prolific forward in the ranks. This had come ahead of schedule to a certain extent, with his transformation of the squad an ongoing process. Yet semi-final exits are excruciating regardless and this was the manager's fourth in succession, with Real and now Chelsea. He had suffered twice before with the Londoners and, for once, cut a rather helpless figure on the sidelines as Atlético prospered. Unless the Premier League can somehow be secured, this will be a second successive campaign without silverware for the Portuguese. There will be a sense of disappointment, not disaster, at that lack of tangible success, but the manager has already said next season must be different. This team must return reinforced and consider themselves proper contenders.
