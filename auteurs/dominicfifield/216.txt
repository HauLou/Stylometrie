In the end, it all felt uncomfortable. All so desperately awkward. As an impartial observer and a guest in Recollections of that semi-final require context. The conviction that Brazil would prevail to fulfil the slogan emblazoned on the team bus â âBrace yourselves: the sixth is comingâ â had grown through the World Cupâs group stage, expectations fuelled through the drama of a penalty shootout win over an excellent Chile in the last 16 and the impressive nature of their dismissal of the much fancied Colombia in Fortaleza.
By the time they arrived in Belo Horizonte even their cause seemed just. Neymar, the teamâs talismanic forward, had been snapped by Juan Camilo Zúñiga, his back broken. Luiz Felipe Scolari and his players had arrived at the semi-final wearing white baseball caps bearing the message The problem was that outpouring of emotion had merely masked the reality. This Brazil had not been beaten in a competitive game on home soil since 1975, but they shipped five goals in 18 minutes before the half-hour mark. César screamed in frustration but those around him merely shrunk as if wishing the turf would swallow them up. The crowd could only gasp at the brutality of it all, summoning a few boos when André Schürrle added a sixth and regularly abusing Fred, who could do no right. They even offered a smattering of applause when the Chelsea forward added a seventh.
By the time Scolari was offering his excuses in the aftermath rumours were already emerging of rioting in São Paulo, vines of the burning of Brazil flags doing the rounds on social media. There were concerns as to how the tournament would conclude, particularly with Argentina still involved and in contention to claim the trophy in their rivalsâ back yard, though the truth was the defeat had rather knocked the stuffing out of the home nation.
They had no energy left to revolt, other than to voice frustration at Scolari and, eventually, hound him from his position. All that remained was deflation after one of the most remarkable capitulations this stage had witnessed. The thrashing was staggering but seemed too emphatic for comfort. It was hard not to share Brazilâs grief at the way their dream died.
