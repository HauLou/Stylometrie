Napoli two years ago when Stamford Bridge shook to its foundations and the Italians collapsed, demoralised and defeated, amid the din.
"We showed what But that was then, this is now. Where Napoli wilted under the onslaught, so PSG are invariably inspired by Zlatan Ibrahimovic â who will be missing with a hamstring problems â but they are built on the authority offered by the man wearing the armband. Where Edinson Cavani, a £54m forward, can fill the void left by the Sweden striker, Silva is arguably irreplaceable. He is a broad shouldered, barrel-chested dynamo of a centre-half blessed with spring and acceleration, as well as that most valuable attribute of all for a defender: an innate sense of anticipation.
"He just sees the game 10 seconds before everyone else," said the former Chelsea and France centre-half, Frank Leboeuf, after watching the first leg. "He cuts out passes, or backs up his full-backs, and that is really impressive."
The assessment was made despite the 29-year-old having lunged in rather unwisely to concede the first-half penalty which briefly handed Chelsea the initiative. By the end the Brazilian had stamped more characteristic authority on the occasion, snuffing out their attempts at a second-half revival.
Silva had been clad in a â¬2,000 mask after damaging his nose in a collision with Lorient's Vincent Aboubakar the previous weekend, yet he cannot go incognito these days. His reputation precedes him. Rewind to the autumn of 2010 and Carlo Ancelotti, a few months after overseeing Chelsea's last Premier League title, held court at a swanky restaurant in west London and asked the throng who they considered to be the best centre-back in the world. Out trotted the usual names â John Terry, Nemanja Vidic, Alessandro Nesta, Carles Puyol, Thomas Vermaelen â but Ancelotti was adamant it was the Brazilian he had left behind when swapping Milan for Stamford Bridge. Silva had only joined Milan in December 2008 but, as a non-EU player, had been unable to play for his new club until July of the following year, by which time Ancelotti had moved on. But, having used that time to study Nesta and Paolo Maldini in training, the defender had still made an impression.
He cost PSG almost twice as much as Ibrahimovic, his departure provoking far more disquiet among the Italian club's supporters than that of the Swede, and, despite the injuries, he has swiftly become integral. He is the heartbeat of PSG, the man from whom they take strength. They can lean on him with a two-goal lead. As Javier Pastore drifts beyond César Azpilicueta and Frank Lampard deep into stoppage time in the first game at Parc des Princes, Silva is standing on the edge of the centre-circle just inside enemy territory, surveying the death throes of the match from afar. Up go the arms as the Argentinian scores, the centre-back planting his legs as if about to summon a haka before erupting instead in a bout of shadow-boxing. There are 11 punches of the air in all before he starts stomping around the centre-circle in celebration. The Vine footage has long since gone viral.
His defensive partner, Alex, is busy sprinting towards Pastore to celebrate at that point. Chelsea might have hoped their former player would prove the weak link, the veteran's impact at Stamford Bridge having faded while his turning circle widened before he fell out spectacularly with André Villas-Boas and became one of the first wave of Qatari additions to PSG's ranks. Yet the 31-year-old was impressive in Paris, his aggression retained and his display reassured by the presence of the compatriot at his side. "Theirs is a really natural partnership," Leboeuf said. "I don't think [Luiz Felipe] Scolari can ignore Alex. I even found myself asking why Chelsea had left him leave."
The centre-back has not played for Brazil in six years, which would suggest his hopes of featuring in the summer are forlorn, yet more displays like last week should at least earn him a contract extension with PSG beyond the summer. He was absent on the three times this season PSG have been beaten â to Evian in Ligue 1, Benfica in the PSG have scored in every Champions League game they have played this season. Napoli, with Ezequiel Lavezzi and Cavani in their number, managed that at Stamford Bridge two years ago, but PSG have lost by two goals only once in 110 games. They will be confident they can resist the ferocity of Chelsea's onslaught .
