He returns as an outsider, hopeful if slightly unsure of the reception he will be afforded at a club for whom he played 197 times before joining âItâs a fantastic stadium, quite tight but really loud. Iâve lots of special memories from my time there, winning league titles and big European games, though that win over Barcelona is probably the best. It will be great to go back for the first time since I left, coming up against some close friends â Scott Brown, Charlie Mulgrew, Shaun Maloney, all top players â in a derby game, the sort you want to experience. If Iâm fortunate enough to play itâll be a special night.â
Forsterâs four-year spell in Glasgow, the first two seasons of which were spent on loan from Newcastle United, yielded three league titles, two Scottish Cups and those eye-catching nights in Europe. There were only nine defeats at Celtic Park along the way, four of which were inflicted by celebrated continental opposition in Barça, Milan, Juventus and, in the Europa League, Atlético Madrid, with his game progressing rapidly through regular involvement and under the watchful eye of the clubâs goalkeeping coach, Stephen Woods.

At 26, he moved to Southampton as a player approaching his pomp. His displays to date, all imposing presence and command of his area with only eight goals conceded in 14 games in all competitions, have confirmed that pedigree. There is an acceptance within the Ben Foster, a player who has grown frustrated at life as a back-up in the past, has acknowledged as much. âHis place as No1 is cemented now,â said the West Bromwich Albion player. âHeâs fantastic and weâre happy to have him. Sure, itâs frustrating at times, but you know the score. We all know our roles.â
Yet, in that context, opportunities such as that which awaits Forster in Glasgow must be taken. âFraserâs strength is his maturity really,â Hodgson said. âHe showed that maturity at Celtic. For a young man heâs had plenty of games and plenty of Champions League games. Coming to Southampton and taking part in such a successful start to the season, it does give confidence. You canât divorce the way players are feeling about themselves from their club football and, at the moment, players like Forster and Nathaniel Clyne are brimming with confidence. If he gets his chance in Perhaps the move to the Premier League was timely in terms of generating a presence that could not go ignored. It will clearly benefit Forster that he is now working on a daily basis with the England goalkeeping coach, Dave Watson, at his own club. âItâs been absolutely brilliant so far,â Forster said. âI had a great time at Celtic and will be forever grateful for what they did for me. They gave me a chance and really believed in me.
âStevie Woods, the goalkeeping coach, put in a lot of time and effort and really brought me on. They gave me the opportunity to play Champions League football and European football. It was something really special and it was just a case of, in the summer, I thought it was time to move on for a new challenge. And weâve had a great start, which is a real credit to the manager and everyone connected with Southampton.
âWith England itâs fantastic to be part of the squad. Joeâs a top keeper. Ben and I know that â we see him in training every day â but weâve got a fantastic group. We work really hard and bring the best out of each other. Youâve got to focus and concentrate because we all want to show what we can do.â The return to Glasgow should offer a chance to do just that.
