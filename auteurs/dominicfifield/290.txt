It was a passing flashpoint, some playful ribbing among team-mates, but it offered an insight into Suárezâs latest recovery from a high-profile misdemeanour. The four-month ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguayâs World Cup victory over Italy in Natal, his third sanction for similar offences, is spent.
In the intervening period the striker has been transferred for £75m from Liverpool, where he had been idolised, to Barça with the suspension a test of patience over recent weeks. At the Bernabéu on Saturday he will be unleashed back into competitive action on the grandest of club stages: There is an acceptance he will be rusty. Suárez has scored braces for Had Julyâs original Fifa judgment not been watered down by the court of arbitration for sport then he would not even have been permitted to train while the ban was in place. As it is, Piqué and his team-mates have experienced his quality first-hand. âWhen he first arrived he couldnât play and hadnât trained, and was dead after 10 minutes,â laughed the defender. âI was saying: âWhat happened to you, man?â But after two or three weeks he started getting fitter, and now heâs ready. In training heâs unbelievable. He has got something.
âWeâve seen it: there will be two or three rebounds in the box and then, definitely, the ball is at his feet and he scores. From nothing he can score. He is a different style of player to those we had before. Xavi, Iniesta â¦ they are really sweet and you enjoy watching them with the ball. With Luis Suárez it is the other side: he fights. But he scores, and that is what it is all about. You can kick him in training and he never falls to the floor. Heâll keep trying to score even if youâre pulling his shirt or fouling him. He is a really fair player.
âPeople say he wasnât in England but, there, if you fall once you have a reputation. In training he never goes to the floor. He pressures defenders to recover the ball. I was really happy we signed him. I donât care if he bit [someone] before. He knows itâs not the way, and he said he wonât do it again. And heâs in the top three strikers in the world.â
Gareth Baleâs untimely buttock injury and Suárezâs lack of match fitness have postponed the ultimate in forward-line set-tos, but this is still Leo Messi against Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar against Karim Benzema, with Suárez, James Rodríguez, Ivan Rakitic and Toni Kroos all entering the frenzy for the first time.
The contest may lack the poison that festered during the tenures of José Mourinho and Pep Guardiola at the respective clubs, but spikiness endures. Piqué has tasted this occasion often enough in the six years since he left Manchester United, though the adrenaline rush of the biggest club fixture in Spanish football is a constant.
âIn England you have the big games but you donât have âThey are strong. Realâs frontline are really quick and powerful. Bale and Cristiano, the wingers, can smash and destroy you if you are not careful. Benzema receives the balls and brings others into the game. But the main thing for us is to be careful when we have the ball because that is when we are open and, if we lose it, they start to run, they play long balls and itâs really difficult to catch them. As defenders, we have to be constantly on our marks. Under Guardiola we played the best football I can remember, playing good games at the Bernabéu and winning most of them. It has been harder in the last few years as weâve not played as we did in the past. But itâs difficult to stay at that level. We are talking about one of the best teams in the history of football.
âUnder Luis Enrique, weâve changed the mentality again and weâre pressuring a lot, really high up the pitch. In the first two or three seconds when [the opposition] have the ball they suffer a lot, as our strikers are pushing them. They have no time to build. Atlético Madrid know that if they donât have the ball they all have to defend, no matter who they are [playing]. They are very compact and difficult to break down. But at Barcelona we are used to having the ball and when we lose it we are open, with a lot of spaces. So if you donât press they can attack those spaces, then you are dead. I know when you win titles the stars are the strikers and when you donât itâs because of the goalkeeper and the defenders, but itâs not just about the defenders. Itâs about all the team working hard together.â
Barça are still adapting to Enrique, even if their league record â seven wins from eight unbeaten matches and a four-point advantage over Real â suggests resurgence. Piqué is reluctantly learning that life is about rotation under this manager, with centre-half duties shared between him, Marc Bartra, Jérémy Mathieu, Javier Mascherano and, once fully fit, the new arrival Thomas Vermaelen. The World Cup and European Championships winner has started only six games in all competitions, sitting out key clashes such as the loss to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. For a player who had won the World Cup at 23 and has claimed two European Cups as well as league titles in England and Spain, life consigned to the fringes can feel incongruous amid constant success.
âItâs not a strange career, itâs a really good career, but now I have a big challenge. At Manchester United I had Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic ahead of me, players who were never injured, never red carded â¦ fucking hard [to dislodge]. But this is the first time at Barcelona Iâm not playing as much as I want to. A lot of people say: âPiqué is not fit or not playing well.â But Piqué is really playing well. After the World Cup I admitted I maybe hadnât been at my level, but in pre-season I worked really hard and Iâm really happy about my performances during the season. I have to show the coach I can play every game and donât need to be rotated because Iâm desperate to play in Retaining his place in the team has become the centre-halfâs priority. He is settled and content in Catalonia, one recent late-night altercation with the guardia urbana aside, with a young family, Shakira on his arm and successful businesses to his name. He is hands-on off the pitch, whether tweaking his phone app or developing his computer management game. There is no desire to return to United, whose interest is persistent and, given their defensive fragility, understandable.
âI was really happy and left a lot of friends there, even if I didnât play as much as Iâd wanted, but Iâve always said I want to stay here all my career and retire at Barcelona,â he added. âAt the moment Iâm not thinking about leaving. Iâm really happy if itâs true that United want me â¦ but Iâm a Barcelona fan, I have been since I was a kid. I want to stay here.â
âHe had a big handicap because he cost a lot of money. There were a lot of questions about him: is he really good? Can he perform well enough to justify costing â¬100m? But I think heâs doing a really good job at Real Madrid. I was injured with my hip when he scored in the Copa del Rey final last season [running around Marc Bartra off the pitch to score the winner]. Would I have fouled him? You are talking about not even one second and you have to make a decision. Itâs easy when youâre sitting on your sofa and say: âAh, you have to do this, you little bastard â¦â But when youâre on the pitch, itâs really difficult to make a good decision.â
âA lot of important players such as Xavi, Xabi Alonso and Puyol have retired, while David Villa is in Australia. Vicente del Bosque has to find replacements. It is a difficult time because, obviously, that is half the team. We won the Euros with the old players, but itâs easy for people to criticise given the World Cup was not as good as weâd hoped. But we have two years to change for the France Euros, where Vicente can improve with the others. We have to qualify and try to find the best team.â
âCesc went to Arsenal first but they said they had [Mesut] Özil, so he went to Chelsea instead. He is really happy there, and playing well. He loves London, even if I donât know if he loves Mourinho. He probably does because he is in the team, playing all the games. In Barcelona it was more difficult for him. It was one of the toughest decisions in his life to leave Barça for a second time but, after three months, you can see he made the right decision. Heâs enjoying his life, playing every minute. He doesnât like to be rotated, and Iâm happy for him.â
