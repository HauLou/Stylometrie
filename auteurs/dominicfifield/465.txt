Raheem Sterlingâs chances of starting Englandâs opening game at the The Liverpool winger was dismissed against Ecuador for a tackle on Antonio Valencia that was acknowledged as ârecklessâ by Roy Hodgson. While the sending-off will not carry a ban into the tournament proper, the teenager is ineligible for the game against âHe was absolutely gutted to be sent off, as were we, but he doesnât seem to have taken it to heart,â said Hodgson after the teamâs session at Barry University on Friday. âThe most important thing is heâs still making me aware heâs a player who can inflict an awful lot of damage on the opposition.
âHis reaction to the red card has been excellent: he was unstoppable at times in training, some of the things he did out there were breathtaking and heâs not going to lose any fitness. The dilemma I have is that I have more than 11 players capable of taking the field against Italy but I donât need to see a performance from Raheem on the field to know heâs capable of playing in the Italy game if selected.
âHe is an exceptional talent â along with our other exceptional talents â and what happened on Wednesday wouldnât stop me. Weâve spoken about it. It happened. The blow is he canât play against Honduras when Iâd like to have seen him play.
âBut I donât think it was an âill-disciplined actâ. It was over-exuberant and slightly reckless. It was his desire to help us out of a difficult situation, using his incredible pace to track back and stop Antonio Valencia. It was a reckless challenge and the referee was entitled to send him off. That was a blow to my plans but it doesnât affect his chances of playing when the tournament starts.â
Hodgson: I don't have England's World Cup starting XI in my head


Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who was arguably Englandâs most impressive performer against Ecuador, was at the Barry University campus continuing his rehabilitation from the medial knee ligament injury sustained in a clumsy challenge by Carlos Gruezo. The strain will keep him out for two weeks and âWe wonât make a decision on him before we go to Brazil,â confirmed Hodgson. âIt will be at the very, very last moment which, by my understanding, is 24 hours before we play our first game.
âBut the physios are working very hard with him, so letâs hope that itâs not that serious and it wonât even be a question of him leaving us. Obviously it was a major blow because he had been playing so well and to see him having such a dominant effect on the game excited us all. But his mood is good. Weâre very anxious to keep him here.
âIâll have to listen to the doctors and see what heâs likely to miss and when heâs likely to be fit but I wonât be dashing out [and calling someone else up] just because he might not be fit for the first game. Weâre entitled to think we may go on further than that. Weâd want people like him around. Iâll be accepting with what the doctors tell me.
âTheyâll tell me their prognosis and then weâll make a decision. Stones and Flanagan will go home as planned. Flanagan has friends staying here in America and Stones will go home but Iâll alert them that, if the worst happens, Iâll probably bring one of them back. Theyâre both fit men in top physical condition but the chances, I hope, are very slim because we want to keep Alex with us.â
Hodgson will grant game-time to the seven players who were not in the match-day squad for the 2-2 draw with Ecuador. The England management will request drinksâ breaks during the match like those which will be adopted in Manaus later this month. Steven Gerrard, who had been suffering from a tight groin in midweek, will start and, as he confronts his third World Cup, has been encouraged by the strength in depth in this squad.
âThere are two players pushing in every position to get into the XI and not much between them in every position,â said the captain. âThe manager could pick five teams for the Italy game and you wouldnât see a big difference in the standard. Thatâs what gives me hope.
âThe youngsters have brought their form from their clubs into the England set-up. Thatâs what Iâve noticed. Hopefully they can continue that into the tournament.
âTheyâre ready to play and thatâs the biggest compliment I can give them.â
