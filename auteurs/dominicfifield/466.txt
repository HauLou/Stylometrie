Rickie Lambert has admitted he struggles to comprehend his rise from the lower leagues to Liverpool and a World Cup with England, as the striker seeks to maintain his eyecatching scoring start to life in the national team in the final friendly before the tournament.
The forward completed a £4.5m move to Anfield shortly before departing for Englandâs two-game preparation in Florida, which culminates with Saturdayâs game against Honduras at the Sun Life Stadium. Lambert is likely to start that match among the substitutes but his goal in the 2-2 draw with Ecuador in midweek left him with three in five caps to offer Roy Hodgson a timely reminder that he remains a potent option to fling on from the bench in Brazil.
The player who has journeyed from Blackpool to Southampton via Macclesfield, Stockport, Rochdale and Bristol Rovers before returning to âYou can get carried away with people who say itâs a completely different world, and you do believe that when youâre in League Two and League One, but if you believe in yourself itâs not. You have to adapt to each level and it improves you when youâre in better teams. Thatâs whatâs happened to me over the years. Every team Iâve played in has just got better and better. Itâs become a lot easier. The goal doesnât move. Itâs the same shape whatever level youâre at and the ballâs the same size and shape. Itâs something weâve practised all our lives.
âItâs been a life-changing couple of years, to be honest with you. Itâs hard to describe whatâs happening at the minute and Iâm just trying to enjoy every second of it. Itâs a dream move for me and Iâm on a high from it. But at my age Iâm not going to get carried away. I know whatâs important.â
Hodgson: I don't have England's World Cup starting XI in my head


The 32-year-old had almost converted Alex Oxlade-Chamberlainâs centre in midweek for his sideâs first goal â Wayne Rooney tapped in behind him â but his finish for the second was emphatically dispatched first time from Ross Barkleyâs pass, his tally already impressive at this level even if it is early days in his international career. He will still start the tournament behind his new club-mate, Daniel Sturridge, in the pecking order but there is faith within the setup that he can make an impact if required. âNo matter how I end up playing, Iâm just trying to give my best,â added Lambert. âIf itâs from the bench and if I do get my chance and come on, then I know Iâve got to do well.
âObviously every minute counts from now and through the âThere are still aspects I want to improve and do better. I scored the goal but there are areas I want to improve. Itâs about getting to know your players as well. But, as a team, there are no agendas. We are all doing a job for the gaffer and whatever role you have in that team, thatâs what it is. Iâm completely happy with that and I think everyone else is as well.â
