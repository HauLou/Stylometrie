Frank Lampard has bemoaned a perceived lack of support offered to English clubs in Europe by the domestic game's governing bodies as Chelsea seek to cope with a disrupted recovery and training schedule before Saturday's west London derby at Fulham, following the 1-1 Champions League draw at Galatasaray.
"It's not ideal," said Lampard, who played the whole game in Istanbul but would be expected to drop to the bench on Saturday as a result. "We don't expect any favours and certainly know we won't get them. It's about resting up and getting ready to go.
"I don't know about the Premier League but other countries seem to look after their teams representing them in the Mourinho has made great play of the cluttered nature of the club's schedule , with domestic fixtures effectively dictated by television coverage, and has support among the other managers still involved in European competition.

"We could have done with Fulham being on a Sunday considering the journey we've had, but you don't get too many favours. We won't make excuses before the game, but we need to get our heads down and concentrate on ourselves. It's tight and that would be a nice gap. Regardless of whether City are playing or not, with "We didn't play particularly well against Everton but it was desire that got us over the line. If you relax for a game you will lose. Look at Fulham, they are fighting for their lives. It would be a lot better if they were mid-table and cruising. You have to be ruthless week on week to get those results."
