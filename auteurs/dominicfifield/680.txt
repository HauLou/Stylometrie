Somewhere amid this helter-skelter of a contest, a refreshing frenzy of offensive play and attacking intent from start to finish, Tim Sherwood delivered a politically shrewd statement of intent. Where others might have reverted to basics upon taking over a side torn to shreds just a week ago, this caretaker favours a bolder approach. A swashbuckling victory on the south coast tapped into his players' underlying qualities and cleansed the club of recent stodgy form and deeply dissatisfying performances.
This team appeared far more comfortable with the handbrake eased off and the onus set upon imposing themselves upon opponents and occasion. Sherwood is seeking to make this job his own â his opposite number here, Mauricio Pochettino, has his own admirers in the Spurs boardroom â and football this attractive and forward-thinking will help his cause. Certainly, the reintegration of Emmanuel Adebayor already seems like a masterstroke, both in terms of basic team structure and to satisfy those on high. The striker's two goals more than justified his inclusion, but everything about this display felt like a statement.
Gone was the defensive midfield shield, albeit with Sandro injured and Paulinho suspended. Étienne Capoue might have fulfilled the role but even when the only real central midfielder, Mousa Dembélé, had limped away with an ankle complaint, the visitors flung on the captain of their under-21 team, Nabil Bentaleb, to fill the void. The interim manager has overseen the France junior's development in his role as technical coordinator, just as he did with Adebayor when he was cast from the senior set-up by Villas-Boas this season, and the board will have been encouraged to witness a young player progressing from academy to first team.
There was a logic to the 19-year-old's involvement. "I don't know Capoue much â I've only had three days' training, so I don't know a lot of these new players â but, at the moment, I know I can trust that kid," said Sherwood. "It's about the heat of the battle and knowing who you can trust, and the kid's ready to play. He trains like every day is the last day in the world, listens and has a fantastic attitude." He was tidy and impressive, his debut a minor sideshow in the context of this team reviving their league form, but subtle, sensible tweaks like that could yet see Sherwood's short-term appointment extended at least until the summer.
It is easy, of course, to thrill at the boldness of the interim's approach in the wake of a victory that has thrust Spurs within four points of the top four. It should not be overlooked that the opening quarter had been rather chastening, the stand-in manager squirming in the directors' box as Better teams than Southampton would have pressed home that advantage, yet Lallana's effervescent performance in front of the England assistant manager Ray Lewington ended up as the home side's only positive from another catastrophic defensive display. The captain's industry would set up Rickie Lambert's second-half equaliser, capitalising on poor judgment by Lloris and Michael Dawson, but did not yield even a point.
Southampton have won only once in the league since October and, with injuries and illness having ripped up their favoured backline, are far too accommodating to opponents these days. "We dressed up as Santa Claus and gifted them so many goals and chances," offered Pochettino with a snarl.
Had Jay Rodriguez thrust them two ahead then maybe they would have prevailed but, as it is, they wilted.
Perhaps Sherwood had sensed they were there for the taking. The equaliser was pilfered on the break, Adebayor sending Roberto Soldado scurrying down the left, where he collected and conjured a glorious centre, which arced into the six-yard box for the Togolese to exploit space between Jos Hooiveld and Fox and volley home. It was the first league goal registered by a Spurs striker since 27 October and a fine way for Adebayor, a scorer in the League Cup in midweek, to celebrate a first start in the competition this season.
Coaxing form from the forward is another of Sherwood's early achievements.
Spurs duly led when Danny Rose's near-post delivery was poked inadvertently through Paulo Gazzaniga by Jos Hooiveld â a fourth own goal in his last 25 games â but Adebayor's central presence was always unsettling. When Nacer Chadli hassled home defenders at a throw-in, the forward slipped free of Fox and Dejan Lovren to turn and score the winner.
This team will benefit with him as their focal point, with Soldado relishing life in a partnership. The Spaniard missed three fine chances in as many minutes to secure the result though, in the end, it mattered not. Spurs' bold approach was maintained to the last, with Jermain Defoe flung on for the latter stages. This team seems comfortable with the shackles off.
