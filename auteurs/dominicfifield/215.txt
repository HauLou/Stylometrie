The 53-year-old was back on Tyneside on Tuesday, entering the clubâs academy via a side entrance, to bid farewell to the squad who he had steered into mid-table in the Premier League after a dismal start. The announcement he has returned to Palace, his first professional club but a side languishing in the relegation zone, on a four-year contract worth around £2m-a-season is anticipated on Wednesday.
While he is unlikely to oversee Palaceâs final training session before they depart for Birmingham, with the caretaker manager Keith Millen having undertaken the preparations this week, Pardewâs preference is to be in the dugout at Villa Park rather than in the directorsâ box. The venue is the scene of his most celebrated moment of his playing career, a headed winner against Liverpool in the 1990 FA Cup semi-final. His eagerness to be involved a reflection of the precarious position in which Palace find themselves.
Pardew and the clubâs co-chairman Steve Parish have already discussed transfer targets for next monthâs window, with Palace eager to secure at least one striker and a left-back. Joel Ward, more naturally a right-back, has been operating on the opposite flank for much of the last year. Bafétimbi Gomis, a striker who interested Pardew at Newcastle before moving to Swansea under freedom of contract last summer, remains a target.
âItâs difficult because weâre trying to bring in players to improve what weâve got, and that doesnât come cheap in January when clubs donât want to lose players,â said Millen, who had been involved in discussions with Parish and the former manager, Neil Warnock, over potential targets. âBut window will be really important. We need some fresh faces to help what weâve got here. We donât need many: one or two, maybe. Weâll be very good then.
âThereâs obviously a relationship between Alan and the club from his playing days. Itâs a new person with new ideas coming in, and that always gives the place a lift. You get that initial surge of energy. You can see in training the lads were bright and enthusiastic. Thereâs that anticipation of someone coming in with fresh ideas. Thereâs a good structure at the club, good organisation in the way we play which has got us success. Itâs important whoever comes in realises what weâre good at.â
This has been Millenâs second spell in temporary charge of the team this season, and third overall, and both he and the first-team coach, Ben Garner, will be retained under the new regime. They are likely to be joined by Andy Woodman on the coaching staff.
