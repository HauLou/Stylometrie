Arsenal are resigned to being without their Wales midfielder Aaron Ramsey for at least a month after scans confirmed the extent of his hamstring injury but the club have at least been reassured that Wilshere still has a slim chance of featuring in Wednesdayâs Champions League group game against Galatasaray at the Emirates stadium despite turning his ankle under a challenge from Danny Rose during the north London derby on Saturday. That injury initially had the England midfielder writhing on the turf in agony, a worrying reaction given the playerâs recent history with ankle complaints. Indeed, while he recovered to play on, he was eventually forced off the pitch just after the hour mark to be replaced by Alexis Sánchez.
Yet, while the joint is undergoing treatment, Arsenal are now confident the 22-year-old will be able to take part in the game at Stamford Bridgeâ when their unbeaten league record will be sorely tested by the leaders â and may even be included among the substitutes when Arsène Wengerâs side attempt to kickstart their European campaign against the Turkish team. Arsenal lost their opening fixture 2-0 at Borussia Dortmund a fortnight ago.
The prognosis on the other players who had to be substituted on Saturday was not as favourable, with Ramsey in particular to be missed. Scans confirmed that the Welshman, replaced at the end of the first period against Meanwhile the calf strain suffered by Mikel Arteta early on in Saturdayâs game will rule him out for three weeks, though there is some relief that the Spaniard will be available again soon after the international window.
Midfield duties will most likely fall on Mathieu Flamini and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain against the Turkish side, with Francis Coquelin and Abou Diaby alternative options. Arsenal might have considered moving Calum Chambers into midfield but are stretched defensively at present, though Per Mertesacker should be available against both Galatasaray and Chelsea in anticipation of resting during the international break given his decision to retire from international football after the World Cup finals.
