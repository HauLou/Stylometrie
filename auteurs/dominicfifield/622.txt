José Mourinho has accused the The Mourinho was asked about Andy Carroll's case for wrongful dismissal against Swansea, when the England striker swung round his right arm and made contact with the top of Chico Flores' head only for the Spaniard to fall to the turf clutching his face, but used that as a chance to revisit the incident at City. "I'm not speaking about this specific case, but I think that simulation has to be punished the same way the aggression is punished," he said. "I don't know if you noticed but, in the game against Man City, I had an exchange of words with one of the City players.
"I was not happy because he was trying to get Matic sent off. He knew he had a yellow card. Matic jumped just in front of me in a very clean way, and the other guy immediately [holds his face]. He knew Matic had a yellow card already. Mike Dean, the fourth official and the linesman were all there, and they decided between them, no yellow card. But if no yellow card for Matic, then for me yellow card for the other guy. He deserves the punishment if he's trying to get the guy sent off. I'm speaking generally, not about Carroll. You have to attack the guys who try to get people sent off." Mourinho subsequently confirmed "the other guy" in question was Negredo.
The Chelsea manager, whose team welcome Newcastle United to Stamford Bridge on Saturday , had been equally critical of Jan Vertonghen's reaction last September when Fernando Torres was sent off for swinging an elbow at the Tottenham Hotspur defender. Asked about his own players' perceived tendency to overreact, with Ramires and Oscar having stood accused of tumbling too easy in search of penalty awards this term, he added: "I keep saying that, for me, Ramires against West Bromwich Albion [to earn a late point in November] is a penalty. But I said, a few weeks ago, that Oscar deserved a yellow card at Southampton, and Ramires a red card at Derby. So I'm the one saying lots of penalty [awards] have deserved a laugh, and no other managers have said that. Maybe I'm the naive one. That's not mind games.
"It's true that foreigners brought this culture [of diving] to England. It doesn't make me feel bad because I was always against it. I've always said that in my side of Europe â Portugal Spain â it is a part where people are (considered) 'smart' when they get a penalty, or when they get a yellow card for somebody being sent off. I always fight against it. It's not just a European problem. It happens elsewhere in the world. It's cultural."
