It seems perverse to consider a player who was earning his 107th cap as effectively on trial but such has been Cole's descent to back-up at Chelsea this term.
The 33-year-old has started only three Premier League matches since 2 November, his passage into the first-team barred by César Azpilicueta's consistent excellence ever since. Yet Cole's weight of experience cannot be ignored. He was as untroubled as ever here, composed and reassuring in his defending and bursting forward whenever possible, usually on to Steven Gerrard's diagonal delivery from deep.
His centre created England's best opening of the first half. Only when the Danes doubled up on him was he anxious but this was a reminder of what he continues to offer. If he continues to be underused by Chelsea at least he will be fresh at the finals.#
One of a quintet of starters from Liverpool, the most that club has contributed to an Sterling was happiest in his combination play with his club-mate Glen Johnson, with the pair taking it turns to torment Peter Ankersen and hit the byline, even if the crosses were erratic. The 19-year-old has been effervescent in his club side's prolific front four and England must seek to unleash him against backtracking full-backs, when his pace could be devastating.
This was only a second cap but he was clever in his positioning, struck the post and, when the buildup play became stodgy, was not afraid to drop deep in search of the ball, even liberating Wayne Rooney with clipped passes over the back line. That is not where he will be at his most dangerous, but this was at least promising.
This felt like a no-win situation for Smalling. A defender used as often at right-back for Manchester United came in at centre-back and, while there were no desperate errors, neither was there an air of complete confidence.
The problem England have at centre-back is Gary Cahill, excellent with Chelsea, appears to be a player who thrives in a regular partnership. He has been strong with John Terry. Likewise with Phil Jagielka but a new face tends to prompt anxiety in Cahill and that reflects poorly on his partner. Smalling was arguably less at fault than the more experienced man when Jakob Poulsen ambled through but the gaping hole between defenders did not suggest a watertight partnership. He will most likely go to Brazil as back-up and if required he will have some convincing to do.
Henderson is a player rebuilding his reputation this season at Anfield, one of the Liverpool contingent who has benefited â by his own admission â from the input of Dr Steve Peters, with this his first England start since November 2010.
He had appeared callow that evening and, despite travelling to Euro 2012, has only ever felt a peripheral player ever since, though the 23-year-old's recent displays have demanded recognition.
England did not liberate him in quite the way Liverpool have managed and he did not carry a goal threat with the Frank Lampard-style charges into enemy territory but he was tidy in possession, the balance comfortable with Jack Wilshere and Gerrard. He benefited from his captain's authority at his back and did not seem overawed by the opportunity, but England could have used him far better.
The Southampton debutant was summoned from the bench and duly impressed in his early dispossession of both Peter Ankersen and Emil Larsen, ever keen to charge up the flank.
His low cross under pressure from Simon Kjaer 10 minutes in was mouth-watering, an indication why Shaw is the Premier League's left-back of the moment, even if Leighton Baines appears to be Roy Hodgson's first choice these days.
He is undoubtedly the future of the national team and this will be the first of many caps. Yet there is still an argument that Shaw would gain more from game-time at the Toulon Under-21 tournament than as the reserve left-back in Brazil, particularly while Cole still offers such quality. That is not to detract from the teenager's talent, with this a first tantalising glimpse of his qualities at this level.
The Southampton midfielder was granted 31 minutes here, but made the most of them all.
His was the most eye-catching cameo, culminating in his trick to tease space from Danny Olsen and pinpoint left-foot delivery for Sturridge to nod the game's only goal.
Lallana displayed fine vision in his passing and clever movement with his running, all neat lay-offs and smart distribution, with darts to the byline also promising.
He is arguably more in form than Wilshere, albeit the Arsenal player was hurt 13 minutes in after a challenge with Daniel Agger and was quieter thereafter, and even Hodgson admitted in the aftermath that Lallana had "made the difference".
That bodes well for heavier involvement come the tournament.
