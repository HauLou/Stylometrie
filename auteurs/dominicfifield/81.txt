It was back in February when the rumours that had been doing the rounds for months firmed up into something far more concrete. Pogba was, indeed, to sever ties with his Italian club and move to the Red Devils, a recently installed manager pinning his hopes on a player forged by English football during a previous apprenticeship in the north-west. Yet, well before the yellow ticker could whirr into action, the truth was out. For Paul, read Mathias Pogba. For Manchester United, substitute Crawley Town.
The striker smiles when the scenario is laid out even if, of the three Pogba brothers, he will be the one taking centre stage for the next few days. While Paul rests a torn hamstring in Turin, his sights set on returning to the Juventus side against Real Madrid for the second leg of the first Champions League semi-final in 12 years later this month, and Mathiasâs twin brother, Florentin, recovers from a similar injury at St-Etienne, the forward will take to the pitch at the Broadfield stadium on Sunday with League One survival his objective. Crawley know victory over Coventry City will guarantee their place in the third tier for another campaign, possibly at the expense of their visitors.
The request is in with the clubâs press office for at least 10 tickets for the Pogba clan, his London-based aunts and uncles as well as friends, family and his first youth-team coach from Paris all clamouring to be at the seasonâs finale. This corner of West Sussex will be racked with tension yet, if the locals are fretting, their Guinea international is growing used to occasions such as these.
âI had exactly the same last year with Crewe, going into the last game needing to win to stay up,â he says, his mind drifting back to Gresty Road when he opened the scoring against Preston and the Railwaymen eventually survived. âThis is a final for us. Last weekend against Peterborough weâd started so well and were ahead with a few minutes to play. Then it all fell to pieces. It was unbelievable. Shocking.
âWeâd been within sight of survival, and then it was snatched away from us. Now it boils down to this. We know what we have to do: thereâs no point worrying about other teams or other matches, we just have to win. Itâs all on this.â
Pogba had scored his first goal since that mid-season move from Pescara at London Road only for a 3-2 lead to evaporate in those frenzied last few minutes, the 4-3 defeat casting Dean Saundersâ side beneath the cut-off. âThereâll be âgood nervesâ ahead of the game,â he says. âItâs not getting to us. If a few players crack under the pressure, it brings everyone down, so itâs about staying calm. We have the experience, and if we stick to the managerâs plan weâll be OK. Personally, Iâm never nervous. Ever. Itâs a football match, thatâs all. Go out on the pitch and give your best, thatâs all you can do.â
Pogba, at 24, sounds worldly wise. A nomadic career has taken him to clubs in France, Spain, Italy, England and Wales, together with trials with teams in Scotland, Germany and the Netherlands. Each move has shaped his footballing education, even if some have been more successful than others. The brothers grew up in the eastern suburbs of Paris, the twins making a name for themselves locally on the five-a-side pitch at La Renardière where they would play, day and night, with friends. Paul, a player Mathias believes will be back in English football one day, would tag along, urged to compete with the older boys, and would return home battered and bruised but stronger for the experience.
âThatâs where we toughened up and Paul, as the youngest, wanted to be like us. He was far too good for players the same age as him, so we told him: âCome and play with us and your game will progress quicker, youâll become stronger.â Just look at him now. It worked.â
Mathias and Florentin, as Paul would after them, went on to play for the local club in Ile de France, US Roissy-en-Brie At 16, they were offered a trial at Celta Vigo and were duly recruited by the clubâs academy. The upheaval affected both. âMentally it was very, very hard: life abroad; leaving friends and family; not speaking the language â¦ we were so young. On my own, I donât think I could have done that. It was hard enough with two.â
They returned two years later, Florentin joining Sedan while Mathias spent time at Kaiserslautern, then an injury-plagued year at Quimper which âalmost cost me my professional career before it had even startedâ. Thankfully, English football came calling.
His younger brother had already been at the United academy for a year, arriving from Roissy via the youth teams at US Torcy and Le Havre, when Bury offered the older Pogba another trial in a game against Wrexham. He scored and, while the Football League club dawdled, the Welsh side, under Saunders, offered a contract. He moved in with Paul in Manchester â âhe was a good flat-mate, no problemâ â and, after two successful Conference campaigns, joined Crewe.
âTheyâd just gone up into In that context, the decision to up sticks and move to Pescara last summer felt risky. The transfer to Serie B had been suggested to his then representative by his younger brotherâs agent, Mino Raiola, though it transpired he had been bought by the sporting director, Giuseppe Pavone, without the go-ahead of the manager, Marco Baroni.
âIt wasnât about going specifically to Italy, even with Paul at Juve by then,â he says. âIâm ambitious and wanted a new challenge, to step up again. But even in those first few weeks, something didnât ring true. It was clear the manager didnât need me. Iâd be in the first-team squad in the week, but would be in the stands or on the bench on a match day. There was no dialogue at all with the coach.
âThe first time I got to speak to him face to face in his office was in December, when I couldnât take any more. He admitted he hadnât seen me play before they signed me and, when heâd actually watched the videos, heâd told [the club] straight away my style wasnât for him. I said to him: âYouâre telling me this in December? Why didnât you tell me when I got here in the summer?â Iâd never have gone there if Iâd known. Perhaps it was about politics, but it was wasted time.â
Pogba spent a few days at Den Haag, scoring in a 7-1 friendly win with 80% of voters on an online fansâ forum urging the Dutch club to sign him. When the contract negotiations dragged, a phone-call from Saunders, appointed Crawleyâs interim manager when John Gregory required heart surgery over Christmas, lured him to Sussex.
This is a short-term arrangement, with much dependent upon the result on Sunday as to whether Pogbaâs stay â like that of Saunders â is extended into next term. Indeed, while Florentin has been establishing himself at St-Etienne in Ligue 1 and Paul claiming successive Serie A titles, with a third for Juve imminent, Mathiasâs career has been a whirlwind. The brothers still speak every day, geeing each other up and sharing their contrasting experiences in the game. There will be a telephone call from Paul, a player coveted in England, Spain and France and whose £75m sale would allow the Italian champions to revamp their squad, wishing him luck against Coventry. Thoughts of Real briefly put to one side.
Mathias will be at the Bernabéu for the second leg of that Champions League tie as the France international seeks to revel on his glittering stage. âIâm protective of him, yes,â adds the emigre to England. âI donât see him as âPaul Pogbaâ like everyone else. For me, heâs âI look at my two brothers: one is at Juve, champions of Italy year after year; the other at a club qualifying for Europe. But why stop there? Why should any of us? Letâs look to climb higher, to do more, achieve better. I want to progress, to play in the Premier League. Thatâs what Iâm targeting. I do think, in the future, all three of us could be playing in the same country, in the same championship, perhaps all against each other. In England. Flo loves England and would love to play here one day. Paul has already been here with Manchester United. He could come back to this country. Itâs possible. Very possible. Weâll see.â
All three are treated like returning heroes when they visit La Renardière these days, the local youngsters using their progress at clubs across Europe as inspiration. But, this weekend, only one of the trio is playing. This is Mathiasâs moment.
