José Mourinho claimed his side had been undermined by "a lack of personality" after Chelsea shipped a late equaliser to West Bromwich Albion to pass up the chance of moving four points clear at the top of the Premier League. The Portuguese added that the 1-1 draw was evidence his side are far from the kind of "complete team" who would be considered title favourites.
The visitors, ahead through Branislav Ivanovic's first-half goal, had failed to impose themselves after the interval and creaked through the latter stages as tempers frayed. Ivanovic was booked for berating an assistant referee and had to be calmed down by his goalkeeper, Petr Cech, with other players squabbling among themselves. Mourinho, who had been denied his captain, John Terry, for a second match because of a minor thigh injury, was dismayed that his players had dropped so deep during those frantic final exchanges. "We were not strong enough to kill the game. They had a reaction and we couldn't cope with the reaction," the manager said. "We started being too deep. I was feeling that, even if I put some attacking players on it wouldn't help because the team were really under pressure and it looked impossible for my defenders to get out of the first third of the pitch â¦
"It was down to a bit of everything: the attacking players stopping to play and giving the opponents the chance to feel more comfortable and with no fear; my defensive line started playing too deep, too back. We gave them the ball and were waiting for them to put it in the box. That's not our game. It's not how we feel comfortable. A little bit of a lack of personality, perhaps. We must have the personality to get out of our half, to not accept that pressure or to play that long in the last third of the pitch. So a bit of everything."
Asked if the result had served to justify his cautious appraisal of his team's title chances over recent weeks, Mourinho said: "Yes. Of course. A 'ready' team, a complete team, kills this game. 2-0. Goodbye. We didn't.
"But it was not very different to the game against City [won 1-0 at the Etihad Stadium last week] because we had lots of chances to kill the game there and never did. We went to the last five or 10 minutes and City had a couple of shots and corners, and the game finished with a corner and they could have equalised."I don't like to individualise: John's a guy with big personality so it might have been different with him, yes. But I'd prefer to say we didn't kill the game. We accepted for too long their dominance in the last 20 minutes and we were punished for our mistakes."
The point moved West Brom up to 17th in the table before Wednesday's fixtures and, while Pepe Mel still awaits his first win as manager, five of his side's next six league games are against teams in the bottom half of the table. "I'm proud of my players," said the Spaniard, who will take his squad to his homeland this week for a warm-weather training camp.
"If we'd scored a goal earlier, we'd have gone on to win the match. It's the best performance we've had because Chelsea are a good team and the players have a good mentality. But the players need a win. Me, too. But this draw against Chelsea, for us, is good because Chelsea are a big team."
