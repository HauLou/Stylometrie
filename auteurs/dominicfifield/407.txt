Belgium departed the World Cup with a snarl after their coach, Marc Wilmots, suggested The Belgians conceded early to Gonzalo Higuaín in their quarter-final and, with their rhythm disrupted throughout, were unable to muster a riposte as they went out of the tournament in Brasília. While the countryâs second appearance in the last eight constitutes a fine achievement, Wilmots was aggrieved and afterwards, having consoled his crestfallen players in the dressing room, vowed his team would come back stronger from this experience.
âYou saw the experience of the Argentinians out there,â said the coach. âThey can distort the rhythm of a game. It can take them 30 seconds to take a throw-in and the referee does nothing about it. We made one small mistake [when Vincent Kompany gave away possession eight minutes in] and they steal the ball and score. You could sense the disappointment in the dressing room but weâll learn from this.

I donât want to be a cry baby but I noticed he made three fouls and no yellow card? The referee never gives fouls against Argentina.
âWe had one foul, and a yellow card. But Iâm not complaining about the refereeing. We move on. Iâm thinking about how we move on and build from this. We need to learn to lose gracefully. Thatâs what Iâm doing.
âThe world has seen that Belgium have an excellent team. We can be proud of our side. But this was a quarter-final in the
