It was when the massed banks of courtiers parted, a hush descending over the lavishly decorated hall in Manama's Safriya palace, that Anthony Hudson experienced "a moment". The head coach, all suited and booted amid the red polyester training gear of his young "Then he started shouting, again in Arabic, and I thought: 'Hold on, what's going on here then?'" recalls the émigré. "It had me worried for a second, in front of royalty wondering what was happening â¦ Turns out he was screaming for the captain, our star player, to go up and sit next to him. I had a moment in that room. Everyone was bursting with pride. We'd won the Under-23s Gulf Cup, the country's first trophy, and it was obvious how much it meant. I spoke to the king later and he knew all the stats for the tournament. That said it all."
The celebratory reception, marking a 1-0 win over Saudi Arabia in the final, was back in September and, if the king had initially been fixated with Essa Ghaleb, it was the man who had masterminded the success who drew most admiring glances. Hudson is virtually an unknown in his homeland. His playing career in England amounted to little more than time at West Ham United's academy and in the lower leagues at Luton Town, the young midfielder forever struggling in his father's shadow. Alan Hudson played alongside Peter Osgood at Chelsea and was capped by his country. Anthony Hudson called short his playing career at 27 after spells with NEC Nijmegen and Wilmington Hammerheads in North Carolina.
Yet, at 32, he is now a senior international manager and one of a few who can point to a major tournament victory on his CV. He was one of the youngest coaches to complete his Uefa pro and A licences. He has worked on the Tottenham Hotspur backroom staff, was described as a "young José Mourinho" by Harry Redknapp when departing to take up the reins at Newport County and has maintained his studies in the years since his spell at the Welsh club was prematurely curtailed. There has been time observing his idols first-hand, at Mourinho's Real Madrid and Marcelo Bielsa at Athletic Bilbao.
Peter Taylor, then coaching the Bahrain seniors, brought him to the Gulf in March 2012, Hudson subsequently working under the Argentinian Gabriel Calderón before, last month, taking charge of the first team setup himself. The immediate aim is to qualify for the 2015 Asia Games. The manager, though, has embarked on a journey that he is convinced will take him to Spain and South America, the Champions League and the World Cup. "Ultimately, that's where I want to be competing," he says. "There isn't a day that goes by without me watching games in Chile or Spain on my laptop and I'm being drawn there. That's the style of football I love but I have to learn about it and the best way to do that is to go there and work under pressure. I need to know how they get their philosophy across.
"I'm in no rush to go back to England. If I was working my way up through lower league football it would be harder to learn those different styles, or to find an environment where you are given the time to get a style across. I'm not the finished product by any means, but if you really believe in something and you know your subject inside out â and I really do try and live it â it filters through to the people around you. I'm passionate about the style of play I want my teams to adopt so, if you keep working, everything will take care of itself."
He may still be young, but his education has been long-standing. Having roomed with Michael Carrick at West Ham â there are still email exchanges between the England midfielder, the Englishman abroad and their former team-mate and ex-Hull forward Richard Garcia â realisation dawned early that his own playing career would be limited. "I carried the weight of my dad's name on my shoulders and I let it affect me," he says. The pair are not close. "I've never used his name to open doors and, when I realised I wasn't going to make it as a player, I fell in love with coaching. I knew I had a chance. I had time on my side and am completely open to hard work. If you haven't made a name for yourself as a player you have to bring something different to the table. That's what I've been searching for."
Something has clicked. The groundwork was done in two successful years with Real Maryland Monarchs in the United States. He learned Spanish â he is currently teaching himself French â and was a stand-out on his pro licence class. The grounding continued at Spurs and Newport, the requests fired off to spend time as an observer at elite clubs.
He has visited 24 top-flight teams to gain experience, though it was his time with Bielsa in Bilbao and Mourinho in Madrid that proved most enlightening. "Bielsa opened my eyes to a way of coaching I'd never experienced before. I'd always been so intrigued by how hard his teams work, whether it was Chile or Bilbao. I'd heard the stories about what a great motivator he was but it's time on the training pitch that instils that work ethic in his players. They feel accountable.
"Players understand very clearly, in black and white, what they need to be doing when and where on the pitch. They buy into it because they know that if they run 50 yards to put a man under pressure, they will win back the ball. Watch how hard his teams work off the ball. Nothing they do is by coincidence. That's harder in the Gulf because of the temperature and the mentality in terms of work ethic is different to, say, a European team. But they still want the ball and, if they see that pressing high up the pitch wins it back, they'll buy into it.
"I visited Mourinho just after he'd dropped [Iker] Casillas and he was under proper pressure. And yet the way he carried himself suggested it wasn't getting to him in the slightest and the aura of confidence he carried must have permeated through to his players. Mourinho is a winner. He can play lots of different ways, but ultimately he just wants to win. With Bielsa, it's almost the style and the way of playing that's as important, if not more so, than the winning. I admire them both.
"You have to stand for something. I would hate to be a coach that plays off the cuff, or just tells his team: 'Go and play.' It scares me to think you could end up with a team that has no identity and plays horrible football. My whole life has been about trying to find a way to win with a certain style."
The DVD of Bayern Munich's riotous performance at Manchester City last week has already been scrutinised and has travelled with Hudson to Thailand, where his team play a friendly on Thursday before next week's Asia Cup qualifier against Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur. The next stage is to transpose the minutiae gleaned from the footage into training sessions in Bangkok.
The standard is improving in the Gulf with Qatar 2022 on the horizon. Working in Bahrain has offered Hudson an insight into what awaits at that tournament, whether it is played in summer or winter. "The heat is unbearable, but you get by. You find ways. We train in the evening, adjusting game times, and they find ways."
More troubling for family and friends back home was the wave of violence that erupted during pro-democracy protests in the wake of the Arab Spring two years ago, an issue highlighted in the sporting world by the controversy over the staging of Formula One Grand Prix on the island kingdom.
Yet the national coach feels cut off from the disquiet. "It'll be hard for people to believe this, but since I've been here I've not seen any problems. Where I live is very peaceful. But I'll freely admit my life is immersed in football, a very one-track existence. I'm in a bubble which means I don't see much outside of football."
At home in Amwaj, to the north of Manama, it is just Hudson and his Rhodesian ridgeback, Dyer, who tends to lounge on the balcony as his master pours over coverage of games from around the globe, firing off emails to his coaching staff through the night with ideas for drills. The under-23s' general manager, Omran Abdulla, has nicknamed him "Headache", having woken too often to lists of chores.
Hudson's diligence is admired in Bahrain, his enthusiasm rubbing off and players and backroom staff alike. He may still be a student of the game but he has already bucked a trend â English coaches are not supposed to export well â and is making a name for himself. At some stage he might return home with his reputation established. "Where will I be in 2022? Either in the World Cup or managing one of the top teams in the Champions League. That's where I want to be." This is a coach who is setting the bar high.
