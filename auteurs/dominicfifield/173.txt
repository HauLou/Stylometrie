The centre-half is one of only three players at the club, alongside âThe club know my position, hopefully I know theirs and it will get done,â he said. âNo talks have happened yet between myself and the club, but we both respect each otherâs position. There are more important players here. Hazardâs one.
âFor me, [securing him to a new contract until 2020] was the most important for the club. Without anyone telling me that, I knew that was the first priority for them. Hopefully theyâll be knocking on the door soon.
âIâll be happy with one more year and then weâll see how we go year by year. Iâve not got much choice. The first year [when his last long-term deal was running down] I was maybe a bit nervous and edgy and hoping and knocking on their door myself. But we had a good chat. I know their position and they know mine. I want to stay and hopefully my performances are showing that and they want to keep me.â
José Mourinho has already gone on record to confirm there are âno doubtsâ Terry will be granted a new deal. The Portuguese and his medical staff have devised specific training regimes to offer the captain his best opportunity to feature regularly, with Terry granted a few daysâ leave before the hectic Christmas schedule to ensure he maintained his fitness.
The player himself is reluctant to spend any time on the sidelines as he seeks a fourth Premier League title. âI donât want to [rest],â he added. âThereâs a lot of pressure. Iâm coming to the end of my career, so itâs important I stay fit and play as much as I can. Itâs difficult when you see young boys come in like Kurt [Zouma]. Heâs been a revelation since he came in: heâs young, fit, strong and hungry and it makes it even more difficult.
âWhen Gary Cahill plays heâs been great, and when Kurt plays heâs been great, so itâs hard to get the balance but weâre all rotating and thereâs enough games to share around. We all want to play every game. Theyâre fighting it out and it could be me any time. Itâs important to remain top of the league and everyone gets their game time.â
