José Mourinho has offered a thinly veiled criticism of Liverpoolâs team selection for their game at Real Madrid on Tuesday night by suggesting that, in contrast, he would always select his strongest lineup when confronting âthe most difficult opponentsâ.
Chelsea visit Anfield on Saturday lunchtime with Liverpool, their Mourinho offered the caveat he was not speaking specifically âabout Liverpoolâ but, as he prepares to send out a strong side at Maribor on Wednesday, he made clear he would not have adopted such a policy. âI donât speak about âBut who knows? Liverpool might play a fantastic match and win and rest players and the players are in great condition to play against The Chelsea manager admitted he had gone âa bit too farâ in his criticism of his own clubâs supporters for what he had perceived to be a downbeat atmosphere at Stamford Bridge for Saturdayâs derby against Queens Park Rangers. The Portuguese, whose side can potentially secure a place in the knockout phase of the Champions League by winning in Slovenia, had likened that game to playing âin an empty stadiumâ and claimed the atmosphere had worsened since his previous spell at the club.
That provoked a furious reaction among some sections of the support. âEverybody at Chelsea knows how much I love the club,â said Mourinho, who did admit regret to be missing his daughterâs 18th birthday to be in Maribor. âHow much I want it to improve and how much I want to be part of the club in the future. Everybody knows [this]. Even a moment of criticism has to be analysed with the eyes of somebody who knows why I came back to Chelsea and why Iâm here with my heart, and why I want to stay for a long time.
âI am just somebody who loves football a lot. I love my job. I am lucky to do my job in the club I like so much and feel such a connection and maybe that makes me lead the club with a different emotion. If I do it in a professional way and concentrate only on training and selection, it is because this is not, for me, just a job. It is more than that, because itâs Chelsea.
âMaybe I go a little bit too far. But I see myself in the stands, watching Chelsea and I want to play, I want to help. If Iâm not a player I cannot play, if Iâm not a coach I cannot make decisions. If Iâm just a fan what can I do to help? Thatâs just my view.â
