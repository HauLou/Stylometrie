McArthurâs transfer would surpass the former club record fee paid to Peterborough last summer for Dwight Gayle, and would cost Palace the same figure Wigan agreed with Leicester City before they opted instead to secure Esteban Cambiasso on a 12-month deal.
There had been suggestions over the weekend that Palace might send Adlène Guedioura the other way, with the finer details of the deal still to be finalised.
Talks continue with Tottenham Hotspur over Zeki Fryers, whom Palace had initially hoped to secure on loan but may now have to sign permanently. The young left-back is apparently already at the training ground in Beckenham in anticipation of the completion of that move to south London.
Glenn Murray could also leave Selhurst Park but only if the new manager Neil Warnock can secure another striker as a replacement.
Nottingham Forest, Reading and Ipswich are all thought to be interested in signing the player who scored 30 Championship goals in Palaceâs promotion season in 2012-13.
