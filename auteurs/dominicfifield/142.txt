David Luiz has insisted he did not fling an elbow at The Brazil centre-half, who was making his first return to Stamford Bridge since last summerâs £48m move to PSG, appeared to connect with Costa four minutes before the interval on Wednesday night but did not draw a sanction from the referee, Björn Kuipers. David Luiz was eventually booked for confronting the striker after the interval, his caution awarded for simulation as he claimed he had been head-butted, but he has since moved to suggest he has no lingering problems with Costa.

Every single player gave everything, and we deserved it. For me, it was so emotional. I was very happy when I played here from the first day to the last.
