âWeâve made huge strides since the World Cup,â said Rooney, who will lead what is expected to be a bold selection against Slovenia with the Manchester United forward likely to be flanked up front by the pace of âBut we want to make sure we cement that now with a good performance here and hopefully come away with the three points. Then we can turn around and say weâve had a fantastic year, a fantastic season with England, and will give us a good platform to kick on for the following season. It would be a great achievement because, in some of the games, weâve played some great football and secured some very good results.â

He was booed relentlessly by the Republic of Ireland support, a legacy of his desire to leave Liverpool this summer, though Hodgson claimed he was interested only in the playerâs âfootballing ability, not his contract disputesâ.The manager and captain insisted that the stalemate against the Republic of Ireland, while disappointing, had at least provided much needed preparation for the competitive fixture against âItâs there, in my mind and Iâm close to it, but the most important thing is the teamâs result,â said Rooney. âIâve still got a few years left playing for England in me, so Iâm sure the record will happen at some stage, but itâs not my biggest concern. When it happens, it happens. It crosses my mind now and again, but itâs not something I sit up thinking about at night.
âMaybe, earlier in my career, going a few games without a goal would have worried me but Iâm not concerned now. I canât deny itâs there for me to do, but Iâd take the three points from this game over scoring any goals against Slovenia. The team comes before I do.
âThis is the last game of the season for all of us, an important match, and we have to be ready, physically and mentally. I believe we are. We understand the importance of the game and have trained very well. Itâs 90 minutes for us to try and get the points we want.â
