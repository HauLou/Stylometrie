âOscar got an injury in his last training session with Chelsea,â said Dunga, who had leant heavily on the player in his eight games since returning as Brazilâs manager after last summerâs World Cup finals. âWe spoke with [José] Mourinho and the doctor at Chelsea and his recuperation will take time.

Brazil, who open their campaign against Peru on 14 June before group games against Colombia and Venezuela, have included the former Real Madrid and Manchester City striker Robinho, who is on loan at Santos from Milan.
