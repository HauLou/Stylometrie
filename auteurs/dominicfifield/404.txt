They took a huge psychological stride in emerging victorious against Belgium and into a first semi-final at this tournament for 24 years. âWe broke through the barrier,â said Lionel Messi through a beaming smile. âWeâve already succeeded in getting ourselves in the four best teams and we want more. For us to be the ones who took that step through the quarter-finals is beautiful.â With memories of Argentinaâs three stumbles at this stage since Italia 90 now banished and a contest with Holland to come on Wednesday, optimism abounds.
This, like their four other wins in Brazil, may have been achieved by a narrow margin but it was more convincing than the scoreline suggested. Where Argentina had relied almost entirely on the brilliance of Messi to propel them to the quarter-finals, here teamwork triumphed. The centre-halves withstood a barrage of late Belgian pressure as the ball was flung upfield to Romelu Lukaku, Daniel van Buyten and Marouane Fellaini.
The midfield defensive shield of Javier Mascherano and Lucas Biglia worked diligently and in tandem, disrupting Belgiumâs rhythm and maintaining possession as tidily as they could. âIn terms of intensity, balance, intelligence and the importance of the stage, it was our best performance by far,â Mascherano said. âWe played like we had to play, against a very good team, with many attacking alternatives.â
Up front it was not just Messi who revelled. Gonzalo Higuaín worked tirelessly to close down Belgiumâs centre-halves or infiltrate the space vacated by defenders attracted to Messiâs darts in possession, with Higuaínâs winning goal dispatched instinctively and clinically from the edge of the area. His first reward of these finals will have bolstered his confidence with Sergio Agüero still hopeful of playing some part having recovered from a hamstring injury. Higuaínâs return to form would temper, albeit marginally, the loss of Angel di María with a torn thigh muscle. The Dutch have reason to be wary of the Napoli striker.
There is the air of Italy 2006 about this team. They are a side, like Marcello Lippiâs champions that year, who have grown slowly into this tournament and whose sheer weight of experience means they can squeeze victories from the most daunting of contests. They are streetwise, canny and awkward opponents and in Messi they have a genius who can spark at any moment, a player unbeaten in his last 25 appearances for Argentina and capable of conjuring a decisive moment.
Ally that with a newfound power of the collective and their claim to be contenders is even more persuasive. âMore than ever before we were a team,â Messi said. âWe ran more than ever, we were more committed than ever. We played a game that I am not used to â running, running â and it worked. Argentina will hope to be fresher than the Dutch in São Paulo on Wednesday, their late efforts to repel Belgium having ensured there was no need for extra time. Higuaín, striking the bar, and Messiâs one-on-one with Thibaut Courtois in stoppage time might have added gloss to their display, but it mattered little that those opportunities were passed up. Marc Wilmots, the Belgium coach, departed the tournament bemoaning the manner in which Argentina broke up the rhythm of the contest but he would do well to learn from such tactics.
Biglia, whose inclusion had seemed risky given his lack of pace, and Mascherano excelled in harrying, intercepting and stifling. Kevin De Bruyne, so influential in the previous round, was forced further and further from goal. Eden Hazard was peripheral and substituted. Without them, Belgium were blunt.
Even the inclusion of Martín Demichelis came off, his partnership with Ezequiel Garay abrasive and unbreached. Marcos Rojoâs return from suspension at left-back will also be a fillip. âIt helped that the midfielders were so close,â Pablo Zabaleta said. âDefensively we were excellent. We knew Belgium were a very tough team physically but we defended set pieces very well. They put a lot of long balls into the box at the end but we coped brilliantly.â
Inevitably, Sabella must spend the next few days damping down all enthusiasm that was so lacking in the buildup to Saturdayâs quarter-final but his dour demeanour should help. Certainly, criticism of his selection and tactics may now be put on hold until his team trot out into Arena Corinthians. âIt has been such a mad Holland are more slippery opposition, their own experience across the frontline likely to pose a different kind of problem. But momentum is now with Argentina.
