Some members of the squad joined their partners after the team's evening meal on the eve of the game, a reality which would have been unheard of under Hodgson's predecessor, Fabio Capello, when even agents and friends were not allowed to visit the hotel so close to a fixture.
Wives, girlfriends and family members are apparently now permitted to stay at the team's pre-match venue, though only in parts of the hotel away from the area allocated for the senior side.
A spokesman for the Football Association confirmed no rules had been broken.
