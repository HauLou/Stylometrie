This was not the dazzling Anything gained from this awkward contest would have represented progress given a recent run of one win in 13 and five successive The visitors generated a flurry of late opportunities on the break to warp the statistical analysis but, for all Roberto Martínezâs customary positivity, this was essentially a gritty away win. The flair can wait. âWe had to be perfect to win against a team full of confidence, but it was a very professional performance,â said Martínez. âWe managed the game very well, carried a good threat and defended with a lot of concentration. We know weâd raised expectations and weâre playing catch-up in the league now, and that we want to be in a better position, but weâre ready now to compete.â
If they had arrived wary of Palaceâs recent form, it was the visitors who celebrated the ideal opening, their first foray forward prompting Damien Delaney to over-commit as he attempted to intercept John Stonesâs pass with Steven Naismith sprinting clear to the byline. His low centre was fizzed across the six-yard box where Julián Speroni could only push the ball on to the on-rushing Romelu Lukaku, the rebound nestling in the corner.
The Belgianâs pace and brawn unsettled the home sideâs rearguard throughout, the striker a bustling presence in the channels even if his heavy touch, and some wild finishing, denied him further reward. âBut I was pleased with the infectious way he was working in the forward line, very powerful and fresh,â added Martínez. âHe sets the standards of our attacking play and he loves taking the responsibility.â He bruised the home side here though, in truth, this all felt like a reality check for Alan Pardew.
The Palace manager had won his first four games in charge, but will arguably have learned more about the task he has taken on in untimely defeat. Certainly the need to reintroduce Mile Jedinak â captain of Australiaâs Asia Cup winning side earlier in the day â and Yannick Bolasie is clear. The former should be available at Leicester on Saturday, where Pape Souaré, a £3.5m signing from Lille who will train with his team-mates for the first time on Tuesday, should offer balance at left-back. How Pardewâs team react to a first setback will be crucial.
They might still have forced parity, particularly in the frenzied spell of pressure whipped up immediately after the concession. Phil Jagielka hacked Dwight Gayleâs clever flick from the goalline â âWhoever invented that goalline technology needs a kick up the bum,â said Pardew â with the impressive Stones blocking well from Yaya Sanogo, on home debut, and Chamakh. Yet the latterâs departure with a broken nose having emerged dazed and bloodied from a clash of heads with Séamus Coleman undermined their efforts. The former Arsenal forward is reborn as a No10 these days and had suggested he might unsettle Besic and Barry. Pardew bemoaned the loss of his âguileâ.
Without him, Palace became far too frantic. Joel Robles did well to deny Jason Puncheon from distance just before the interval but the quality had rather ebbed from the contest, the home sideâs desperation a mess of poor decisions or overhit delivery. It was Everton who threatened more coherently on the counter. Lukaku just failed to convert from Aiden McGeadyâs low centre with the Irishman later forcing Speroni into a fine one-handed save from long range. As it transpired, they did not need a second to squeeze home. Everton can start to look onwards and upwards again.
