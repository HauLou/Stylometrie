Raheem Sterlingâs displays in training since linking up with the England squad have thrust him firmly into Roy Hodgsonâs thinking for a starting place at the The teenagerâs late surge of form during the domestic campaign justifiably earned him a place in Hodgsonâs 23-man squad for the tournament in Brazil and the coaching staff noted his attitude and confidence while at the partyâs training camp at Vale do Lobo in Portugal last week.
The squad, plus the young standby players, Jon Flanagan of Sterling, 19, could operate out wide or at the tip of a midfield diamond, though it was his fearlessness and willingness to run at defenders that earmarked him for a role against Italy in Englandâs opening group fixture in Brazil.
He performed encouragingly in the friendly win over Denmark in March, 17 months after gaining his first cap in the loss in Sweden in November 2012, with the upturn in his form over the Premier League run-in ensuring his inclusion.
Hodgson intends to use all of his squad in the two friendlies in Miami, against Honduras and Ecuador, immediately before the finals but will explore combinations and formations against Peru with the game in Manaus in mind. He is expected to employ a 4-2-3-1 formation with Sterling operating from the right flank, Adam Lallana of Southampton on the left and Wayne Rooney in a slightly deeper-lying central role. Daniel Sturridge, so prolific for Liverpool last term, would then play as the teamâs most advanced central striker.
Hodgson, meanwhile, knows that a successful partnership between Rooney and Sturridge could prove pivotal to Englandâs progress during next monthâs World Cup but has admitted that, right now, the much-vaunted double act involving the Manchester United and Liverpool forwards has enjoyed precious little rehearsal time.
âWe havenât really seen it [Rooney and Sturridge playing together for England],â acknowledged the manager, whose side fly to Florida at the weekend en route to another training camp that will serve as a final staging post before they embark on their Brazilian adventure. âWe saw it for 20 minutes before Daniel got injured, in the game against Republic of Ireland.
âWeâve seen an awful lot of the Sturridge/[Luis] Suárez partnership, but not a lot of the Rooney/Sturridge partnership because they simply havenât had a lot of time to play together.
âNowâs our chance. This week we start to move away from the bigger focus on fitness and getting people in the right shape, to tactical preparation. Thatâs when the partnerships will start to develop. It wonât just be Rooney/Sturridge, we will be working on Welbeck and Lambert as well.
âI think itâs too early to start making big bold statements and judgments on the Rooney/Sturridge partnership being X or Y, because we havenât seen enough of it.â
