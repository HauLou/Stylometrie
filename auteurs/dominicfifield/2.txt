Chelsea and The midfielder, a key figure when the England Under-17s won the European Championship in 2010 and the last remaining member still at the club of the Chelsea team who claimed the FA Youth Cup in the same year, had been pinpointed by the then senior manager, Carlo Ancelotti, as a homegrown talent with the potential to break regularly into the first-team at Stamford Bridge.
The Italian handed McEachran his first-team debut in the Champions League against Zilina at the age of 17 and he made 17 appearances in 2010-11, Ancelottiâs last season. At 18, he signed a five-year contract worth £2m-a-season. But, if that was a sign of the esteem in which he was held by the club through whose academy he had progressed, opportunities have proved distinctly limited under Ancelottiâs successors.

His final appearance for Chelsea was a six-minute cameo under André Villas-Boas in a Premier League win at Wolves on 2 January, 2012, with his career transformed into a succession of loan spells over recent seasons. McEachran, who has 13 caps for England Under-21s having progressed through the national ranks from under-16 level, was under-used by Brendan Rodgers at Swansea, while a year at Middlesbrough in the He returned to the second tier with Watford and Wigan in 2013-14 before spending last term at Vitesse Arnhem, who have taken a number of Chelsea players on loan in recent years.

Bosz confirmed last week that Vitesse would not be retaining the midfielder as Brentford, now coached by Marinus Dijkhuizen following Mark Warburtonâs departure at the end of last season, have offered the player a four-year contract as the Championship club aim to build on last yearâs fifth-place finish. The weekend was spent trying to iron out some details of the proposed deal, but agreement is apparently close and confirmation is expected this week. They have already signed Konstantin Kirschbaumer from Admira Wacker, Yoann Barbet from Chamois Niortais , Morecambeâs Ryan Williams and Akaki Gogia from Hallescher.
