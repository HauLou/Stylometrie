Money tends to tell at the foot of this division, although for now Shane Long and Nikica Jelavic should surely, in time, edge their new club to safety but they could not hurt Palace here and, from nowhere, a team who languished bottom upon Pulis's appointment in November sit a lofty 14th. This remains a painfully congested division from middle to foot and the manager admitted he was "hoping and praying" to conjure up some signings in the hours remaining before the transfer deadline. And yet, with a seventh clean sheet in 14 matches, this team are clawing their way up the table.
Not that the manager's instinctive sense of caution has been allayed. "We still need 17 points, and there are 15 games to go, and that's a massive ask," Pulis said. "I won't take any satisfaction from the job until the end of the season if we get those 40 points. We'll have a glass of wine then if we manage it. Everyone said Palace were going to be relegated but we're looking forward, not back."
They are also looking up. This was actually one of their less impressive displays among Pulis' 12 games in charge â six have yielded victory â and there were times, particularly in an anxious second period, when they were horribly stretched. Hull were orchestrated expertly by Tom Huddlestone and, with Long and Jelavic offering movement and brawn up front, the impetus theirs as Palace struggled to contain them. Jake Livermore might have levelled the scores even if the best opportunity fell to Liam Rosenior. The wing-back had drifted into the six-yard box unnoticed to seek out Livermore's cutback, only for his shot to squirt from his boot and marginally wide of the post.
That was at the height of Palace's sloppiness and yet the visitors could find no way through and ended up feeling distinctly aggrieved. Their complaints centred on Long's early tumble in the box, his right leg seeking out contact and caught between Danny Gabiddon's stride as he leant into the centre-half. "The defender clatters into the back of him, so it's beyond me the referee doesn't give it,"Steve Bruce said. "But I can't say too much because I've just had to pay a fine of £10,000 six weeks ago."
Pulis rejected that analysis, claiming: "Long runs across Gabiddon, not the other way round." To darken Hull's mood further, Bruce lost his goalkeeper Allan McGregor in stoppage time. The Scot had already squared up to Cameron Jerome when, moments later, Stuart O'Keefe clattered him late and McGregor's livid kick at the Palace substitute duly prompted a red card. Bruce had made all his substitutions so Huddlestone had to go in goal.
"He's sent my goalkeeper off for kicking the player but the challenge is over the top, on the shin," Bruce said. "McGregor has thought about kicking him and had every right to kick him but he restrained himself. If that's kicking someone, that's not right." The manager intends to appeal, although he will do well to overturn the three-match ban for violent conduct. City have lost four league games in succession and their early sprint into mid-table has come to a juddering halt.
While they regress, Palace's conviction is pepped. Their qualities are rugged and raw at times but the resilience they displayed here was admirable and, had familiar bluntness not led them to fluff their lines in front of goal so often, they might have earned further reward. As it was, Jason Puncheon found his range to maintain a record of having scored all his team's league goals this calendar year.
The winner was born of Yannick Bolasie's persistence on the opposite flank, sprinting beyond Rosenior who crumpled meekly to the turf. The winger's first cutback struck his prone opponent, but there was time enough for him to regather and find Puncheon with Hull's defence in disarray. The Southampton loanee's header would still have flown wide had it not struck Marouane Chamakh, with Puncheon thumping home the rebound. Luck is with this team at present. Pulis would argue that, at no expense, it has been earned.
