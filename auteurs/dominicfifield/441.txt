Uruguayâs limitations as a team leave them overly reliant on Luis Suárez and Edinson Cavani up front and vulnerable at the back to Englandâs raw pace, according to the Last month the former Newcastle and Hibernian midfielder took his team to Montevideo, where they were narrowly beaten by a second-half Christian Stuani goal, despite La Celeste enjoying the bulk of possession at the Estádio Centenario. Suárez was absent from that fixture because he was in rehabilitation following keyhole surgery on a knee but will return to Uruguayâs starting lineup for the crucial Group D fixture against England in Sao Paulo  on Thursdayas both teams seek to recover from defeats in their opening World Cup matches.
OâNeill spied plenty of positives for Roy Hodgson from that friendly in Montevideo and does not share othersâ belief that âThe rest of the team is solid and itâs workmanlike but they donât have a midfield player who is particularly creative. There is no [Andrea] Pirlo in there, or any player of that level. Stuani is kind of a threat but they are there to be got at because [Diego] Lugano wants to play deep, so the team plays deep, and that means the front two sometimes get isolated. The team gets kind of fractured and they go direct quite a bit. They donât play a typical South American game. When you watch Suárez and Cavani they want the ball early.
âSuárez wants to get into the wide areas and run the channels where he can run at people but, given the significance of the first game, why didnât they throw him on when they were 2-1 down? If he wasnât fit enough to play the last 15 minutes when there was still something on offer, how much fitter is he going to be five days later? I wonder how realistic it is to think he will have an impact on this game.
âCavani likes to play the width of the box more but, in terms of what is behind that, it is a very, very rigid 4-4-2. They didnât get a lot of men forward against us. Neither of the central midfield players get themselves into attacking areas in the box. They condense the pitch and then rely on the front two. Obviously, Suárez didnât play against us and Diego Forlán didnât give them the same energy that Suárez would have given them. They donât press like, say, a Chile or an Argentina.â
Uruguay, who will be without the suspended right-back Maxi Pereira against England, were beaten 3-1 by Costa Rica in their first game, despite taking an early lead, with the back lineâs vulnerability exposed by the Central Americansâ eager running, which exposed Lugano, of West Bromwich Albion, in particular. âI spoke with the Uruguayan FA while I was out there and they believe Lugano is a really important player for them,â said OâNeill. âThey see him as the mainstay of the team because he is a leader but I think he is the one you can play on. He doesnât have the legs any more.
