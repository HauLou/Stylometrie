Andros Townsend is set to make his England debut in Friday night's critical World Cup qualifier against Montenegro, as part of a bold attack-minded selection which does not include Wilshere will be among the substitutes as Hodgson prefers the experience of his captain Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, who boast a combined 207 caps, as a central midfield shield with Wayne Rooney operating behind Daniel Sturridge upfront and Danny Welbeck on the left.
Lampard and Gerrard trained together at London Colney on Thursday and Hodgson has opted for the goal threat posed by the Chelsea veteran ahead also of Manchester United's Michael Carrick.

Hart; Walker, Jagielka, Cahill, Baines; Gerrard, Lampard; Townsend, Rooney, Welbeck; Sturridge.
