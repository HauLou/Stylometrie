Roberto Martínez instinctively denied it, preferring to rejoice in fine âgame managementâ almost as code for sweat and endeavour, but this was real evidence Everton scored early through Romelu Lukakuâs 10th goal of the season, the Belgian bundling in Julián Speroniâs weak push from close range, and clung on while Lukakuâs finish was instinctive, anticipating the goalkeeperâs parry of Steven Naismithâs low cross, and although his first touch remains erratic his aggression in the channels still marks him out as a wrecker of defendersâ reputations. He has drawn criticism at times but he has a goal more than at this stage last season, when he was a Chelsea loanee at Goodison Park. âHe is a joy to work with,â said Martínez. âHe has never shied away from the responsibility.
âHe wanted to be there, to put himself in the spotlight. I donât think he gets the credit he deserves. But he is a young man and once people see what he can do consistently they will get excited. Youâd be surprised how he has been getting stronger and better in every game. Now he has reached the physical level where he plays his best: all power and pace. But we are all part of a team and if the team doesnât get the results when you face adversity you learn a lot more from each individual. The reality is that this squad is ready to try and kick on again.â
Liverpool will test that conviction, but Everton will be better placed to unnerve them with James McCarthy nearing a return after persistent hamstring trouble and Ross Barkley given a rest among the substitutes. Palace will have to demonstrate they, too, can recover after suffering the first setback of Alan Pardewâs brief tenure. This was a strangely spluttering display, wrecked by Marouane Chamakhâs departure with a broken nose and a lack of guile and subtlety thereafter.
Jordon Mutch appeared a little lost on debut, and Yaya Sanogo too isolated on his first appearance at Selhurst Park. The manager has options with four arrivals in the transfer window to date â Pape Souaré will join his team-mates on Tuesday after his £3.45m signing from Lille, while Shola Ameobi works on his fitness â and Pardew will monitor the market on deadline day. The priority is at the back with his team too often left playing catch-up. âWe canât keep falling behind and giving teams a head start,â said Scott Dann. âMore often than not you canât get back in the game and that showed here. We need to make sure we stop conceding early goals.â
