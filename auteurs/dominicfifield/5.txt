Queens Park Rangers have rejected an opening offer worth £12m from managerless Austin, a £4m signing from Burnley in the summer of 2013, enjoyed an eye-catching first season in the top flight despite QPRâs relegation and was rewarded for his 18 league goals with a call-up to Roy Hodgsonâs full England squad for the summer internationals against the Republic of Ireland and Slovenia. The 25-year-old has entered the final year of his contract at Loftus Road but The west London club made that stance clear early in the window but had still been braced for bids for the striker for some time. Leicester, who sacked Nigel Pearson on Tuesday citing âdifferences in perspectiveâ between the manager and the clubâs ownership, have now kick-started the bidding process regardless, though QPR were quick to reject their first bid. West Bromwich Albion, who retain an interest in Austinâs club-mate Matt Phillips, have also tracked the forwardâs progress as Tony Pulis seeks reinforcements, though the Black Country club are now the subject of a takeover bid.
West Ham United and Southampton, who have a campaign in the Europa League ahead, may also enter the running for the strikerâs signature. Newcastle United are also interested while Crystal Palace, who have yet to add to their ranks this summer, have tentatively explored the possibility of a player plus cash deal with the former Manchester United, Hull and Cardiff City forward Fraizer Campbell potentially swapping Selhurst Park for Loftus Road. As yet, that proposal has not proved appealing to QPR.
Austin was recently married and is on his honeymoon but will hold further talks with the hierarchy at his current club upon his return for pre-season training. There is understandable concern that, should he play in the second tier next term, his chances of retaining an involvement within the England setup would be affected. As yet, he has offered no indication that he would be willing to extend his stay at the club beyond the expiry of his current contract next year.
