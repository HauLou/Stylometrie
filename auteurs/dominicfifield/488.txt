For a man who had just restored Queens Park Rangers to the elite, and in the most unlikely of circumstances, Harry Redknappâs mood was actually rather downbeat. Outside in the arena his midfielder, Joey Barton, was still chairing a beaming Tony Fernandes round the perimeter on his shoulders. The play-off trophy was being passed between team-mates, while delirious fans celebrated in disbelief. And yet the manager was just exhausted. Drained. Utterly spent.
Redknapp, clad in the âluckyâ suit he had worn for the play-off semi-final against Wigan, was just pining for a retreat home, a bowl of pasta at his local Italian, and a celebratory glass of red wine with his wife. This has been a slog of a season. âBut not as tough as the year before,â he offered, his mind briefly casting back further, to the failure to secure the England job, the leaving of Tottenham Hotspur and, most sapping of all, the court case for tax evasion at which he was eventually cleared. âThe year before was the toughest of my life â¦ I wouldnât want to go through that again. This is only kidâs play. Itâs a game, isnât it.â
It was one QPR simply had to win. Those in the boardroom needed the respite offered by promotion, which will be worth around £80m to this club after only a year of parachute payments in the second tier. There is likely to be a fine of up to £50m to follow in the new year given the clubâs losses â £65.4m last time they were in the elite â will surely exceed the £8m permitted by the Football Leagueâs financial fair play regulations, but those concerns are for the future. The alternative, flailing around in the Redknapp relied on his old guard here, players with vastly more top-flight experience than that enjoyed by a refreshing and youthful They had clung on for long periods, their number depleted for 30 minutes and possession favouring Derby. âHanging on for grim life â¦â Redknapp said. âI could only see extra time and penalties. I know people thought weâd go up automatically, but weâve only really had one striker all year. Bobby wasnât fit, Andy Johnson too, and when Charlie Austin and Matty Phillips got injured we went âboshâ. No one could score a goal. I never thought weâd walk the division. Not many teams come down and go straight back up. And itâll be a fight again next year, too.â One the manager will take on with relish once his batteries are recharged.
Steve McClaren and his players had applauded the victors up in the royal box in the hope the numbed sense of disappointment serves as an inspiration for next term. It was a memory they will not wish to repeat. Back in the dressing room the manager addressed his players, many in floods of tears, and reminded them of the progress they have enjoyed this term. The vow was to improve again. This was insanely harsh, a brutal defeat for all that The midfielder was physically sick in the tunnel, aware of the implications of the foul he had committed in cynically clipping the forward who was darting through on goal. âI thought it was best [to bring him down] because it looked like he was going to score, so I took a red card and we got promoted,â he said. âBut my emotions were all over the place in the tunnel â I smashed up one of the kit manâs cases, and I was worried 40,000 fans who had paid a lot of money to follow us all season would hold it against me.â
That was no consolation for Derby, whose own midfield was slick and inventive, their interplay illuminating at times, even if this was no time for a team who had plundered 84 times in the season proper â more than anyone else â to be blunt. They will now seek to secure the excellent George Thorne and Andre Wisdom on loan, or better, for next term with new terms also likely to be offered to Will Hughes and Craig Bryson.
âThe priority is keeping the players we have,â said McClaren, whose impact since succeeding Nigel Clough, with 74 points from 35 games, has been phenomenal and should not go forgotten in defeat. âItâll take character. But weâve raised expectations, and quite rightly. We should be proud of that. Weâll look back with a bit of anger, sadness and remorse, but in a few days weâll look to the future, and it looks bright.â For QPR, it could be dazzling.
