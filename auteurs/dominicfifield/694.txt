Zouma, a France junior and under-21 international, had featured heavily for Arsenal and City have been monitoring his progress and were expected to bid for his services at the end of the current campaign, with representatives from Monaco having reportedly already met the defender's agent. Chelsea's instinct would have been to wait until next summer too but, aware that others have declared an interest, they are expected to bring forward an offer in the hope he can be prised early from the Ligue 1 club.
Zouma, who would be eligible for the Champions League this term, described his clash with Guerbert as "an unintentional accident" and apologised to his wounded opponent in the dressing room after the tackle. Yet the teenager's football reputation remains intact, with the France manager Didier Deschamps earlier this year earmarking him as a future captain of Les Bleus.
It remains to be seen what immediate impact, if any, his arrival might have on the likes of David Luiz or, indeed, John Terry whose contract expires next summer. Jos√© Mourinho has already indicated he expects both Terry and Ashley Cole to sign new deals at Stamford Bridge, even if no talks have, as yet, taken place.
The Chelsea manager has also stated publicly that he did not expect any major business in the January transfer window, although moves by rivals could yet force his club's hierarchy to act sooner rather than later.
