The Argentina manager, Alejandro Sabella, has admitted Germanyâs freshness will hand them a considerable advantage in Sundayâs The goalkeeper, Sergio Romero, who worked under âGermany are always a very difficult hurdle to overcome, and even more so when theyâve had the extra day and, indeed, could rein themselves in for the second half last night,â said Sabella, referring to Joachim Löwâs sideâs 7-1 thrashing of Brazil when the contest had effectively been settled by the break. âWeâve had to expend every drop of energy just to play in the World Cup final. So that is an advantage for them. In 1998 âI have huge admiration for Germany. They have always shown physical might, tactical powers, mental force and have always had the players with a certain South American touch. They know what team-work is. They have been planning for a long time. They know about organisation. The match is extremely difficult, and they havenât played extra-time when weâve played two periods in this tournament. But all I can say is Iâm thrilled. Weâve made it into the final and crossed the Rubicon. Weâll do everything possible to win this title now, and Iâm thrilled with my players.â
Van Gaal, who will take up the reins formally at Manchester United after Saturdayâs third-place play-off against Brazil, praised his players for contributing a âfantastic tournamentâ but suggested two of them had declined to take the first penalty in the shoot-out despite the teamâs success against Costa Rica via spot kicks in the quarter-final.
âIt should give you confidence, playing another one having just had a shoot-out, and we took those penalties in an incredible way against Costa Rica,â he said. âBut the issue is you need to score the first one and I asked two players to take the first ball before ending up with Vlaar. I thought he was the best player on the pitch so should have a lot of confidence. It just goes to show itâs not easy scoring in a penalty shoot-out.â
The Dutch coach, already without the substituted Robin van Persie, had been unable to fling on his reserve goalkeeper, Tim Krul, at the end as he had in Salvador having already used all three substitutes. He duly watched as Argentinaâs Romero, whom he had signed at AZ Alkmaar for £1.2m back in 2007, saved from Vlaar and Wesley Sneijder to knock his team out. âArgentina have top players, and we didnât lose against them, but the penalties are down to luck,â he added before joking: âI taught Romero how to stop penalties, so that hurts.â
