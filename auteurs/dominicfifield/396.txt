Argentinaâs progress into Sundayâs final at the Maracanã after a more predictable semi than that served up in the Estádio Mineirão the previous evening means the localsâ nightmare is almost complete. Brazil had been fearful of an Argentine triumph at this tournament long before they suffered their humiliation against Germany. Now Alejandro Sabellaâs side can truly contemplate success in their bitter rivalsâ back yard and a first While these two teams were huffing and puffing to little effect, expending energy as they meandered into each other in the drizzle over two forgettable hours, the Germans had their feet up back at their coastal retreat. They were arguably the biggest winners in São Paulo, as they had been in Belo Horizonte the previous evening. Joachim Löwâs side will still be basking in the record thrashing inflicted upon Brazil with the prospect of confronting either of these teams after such a draining, tight semi-final hardly enough to have them quaking in their boots. They will not benefit from the same swathes of vacant space in the Maracanã, with The The game was approaching the half-hour mark when the former West Ham and Liverpool midfielder leapt for an aerial challenge with Georginio Wijnaldum and clashed heads, Mascherano stumbling away dazed before crumpling to the turf, eyes looking vacant. The impact had been flush on his temple, the initial impression one that he simply could not continue. The medics on scene apparently determined the player had not lost consciousness, or risked concussion, and allowed him to play on. That was a big shout for Argentina, as his involvement was of key importance. Mascherano sits at the base of Argentinaâs midfield, intercepting and tackling feverishly. He is the industry to Messiâs sorcery. He may no longer be captain of this lineup but his influence remains colossal, with Mascherano the player who had delivered the team talk about no longer wanting to âeat shitâ that set the mood for the 1-0 quarter-final win over Belgium. His display suffered briefly after the clash of heads, his radar momentarily awry, but he remained metronomic in his duties and his challenge on Robben at the death forced the extra period.
Perhaps the Dutch obsession with nullifying Messi inevitably had a detrimental effect in terms of their ability to tap into their own attacking threats, chiefly Robin van Persie and Robben. The contest passed both players by, with the Manchester United forward barely mustering a touch, let alone a shot all night. Wesley Sneijder, nominally charged with being this teamâs central playmaker, failed to find Van Persie with a single pass over the strikerâs 96 minutes on the pitch. Robben was just as shackled, managing only six touches in the opening period. He was clattered early after the break by Martin Demichelis, the Manchester City defender having suggested in the build-up that Robben could be roughed up. âHe doesnât like physical contact, so you have to get under his skin,â he had said. âWe have to be aggressive, especially to Robben.âThe winger caught the one clear sight of goal in the final minute of normal time, but there was the outstanding Mascherano to stifle his goal attempt.
