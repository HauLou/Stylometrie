José Mourinho believes Diego Costa is capable of mustering the âsame profile of careerâ at Chelsea as Didier Drogba after the Spain international took his goal tally at his new club to seven in his first four matches with a devastating 22-minute hat-trick against Swansea.
The home side came from a goal down to overwhelm the Welsh club and maintain their perfect start to the new campaign in the process, with the £32m signing from Atlético Madrid becoming the first Chelsea player in 86 years to score in each of his first four games for the club. Loïc Rémy, a late debutant, also scored to ensure Mourinho conceded Costaâs productive start to the campaign had been a surprise but pointed to the Brazil-born forwardâs strength and power having already justified Chelseaâs patience in waiting to sign him rather than entering the market for an alternative target during the winter window last season.
âIf the team plays well, he has to score goals,â said the manager. âSeven goals in four Premier League matches is maybe a bit too much â we cannot expect him to have, say, 14 after eight games â but the way heâs playing â¦ If he keeps scoring as he is, that will give us a chance to stay at the top.
âHe hasnât surprised me. Maybe seven in four has surprised me â thatâs not normal â but heâs comfortable in the team. We were building the side in a way where we were waiting for a certain type of striker. I think everyone knows now why Chelsea did well to wait for Diego rather than buying someone else in the midwinter last season. We didnât want just to buy a striker. It is hard to compare with Didier. He started in 2004, 10 years ago, and had a fantastic career here. But Diego has shown he can have that same profile of career, yes.â
Drogba, who missed this game with an ankle injury, will have his fitness assessed before Wednesdayâs visit of Schalke in the Champions League. âThat group is more difficult than people think,â added Mourinho when asked about his teamâs prospects in Europe. âItâs not because Iâm Portuguese, but the Portuguese teams are always very difficult. Itâs not a strong league, but the three top teams are very strong, very good. If you go to Chelseaâs history, when Chelsea play against Benfica or Porto it was difficult, so against Sporting [Lisbon], itâll be difficult.
âThe Germans are the Germans. Schalke have improved a lot since last season. Iâve not analysed Maribor yet, as the last team weâll play against, but our group is difficult. Itâs hard. And we have [domestic] fixtures that are like a poisonous gift for us after European ties: we play City, Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool after Champions League games. So there are some difficult weeks ahead of us.â
