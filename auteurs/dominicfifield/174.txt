John Terry has hailed Thibaut Courtoisâ impact in the Courtois was outstanding at Parc des Princes on Tuesday night as the Premier League leaders secured a potentially valuable 1-1 draw at Paris Saint-Germain in the first leg of their Champions League knockout tie. The young Belgian, who had spent the previous three seasons on loan at Atlético Madrid, had been rested for last weekâs victory over Everton when Cech had produced two eye-catching saves to deny Romelu Lukaku and help maintain the sideâs seven point advantage at the top of the division.
Yet Cech returned to the bench in Paris, with Courtois reserving his best block to deny Zlatan Ibrahimovicâs header in stoppage time at the end. âCourtois is different class,â said Terry. âI saw enough of him in the semi-finals last season [when Atlético knocked Chelsea out 3-1 on aggregate]. Itâs unlucky for Big Pete because he made two unbelievable saves from Lukaku against Everton, but he has been unbelievably professional around the club this season. Iâve seen a lot of players in my time throw their toys out of the pram but heâs been different class for the team, and thatâs been important.â
José Mourinho faces an awkward decision next month when he chooses his lineup for the Capital One Cup final against Tottenham Hotspur. Cech played in the early rounds of the competition, only for Courtois to feature in both legs of the semi-final against Liverpool as the London club prevailed 2-1 on aggregate.
âThe manager stresses the importance of the team coming first,â said Terry. âTheyâre both there for the whole squad. Both of them have been excellent. Weâve got the two best goalkeepers in the world, in my opinion, both fighting for one place, so itâs difficult. You canât keep them both happy. The manager manages to do it, I donât know how. Obviously they both want to play all the time, but the two of them are at the top of their games. Rotating them is a tough job. Iâd rather that was the managerâs decision.â
Asked whether he thought Cech would seek to move at the end of the season, ending what would be an 11-year career at Stamford Bridge, the captain added: âWeâve not even spoken and credit to Pete: heâs not grumbled or sent shockwaves through the dressing room. Heâs been really professional. He knows heâs been a top keeper and still has a lot to give. Heâs fighting for his place. He hasnât just given up and said: âItâs yours, Thibautâ. When heâs come in heâs been brilliant and given the manager food for thought. He could play for anyone, and heâs been different class for us. Heâs been worth 10-12 points every season.â
Chelseaâs goal in Paris was scored by Branislav Ivanovic, the right-back nodding in after Terryâs cross was flicked on by Gary Cahill. The Serb has scored critical winners against Liverpool and Aston Villa in recent weeks, and now boasts more goals â seven â than any other defender in the âLook at the Liverpool one a couple of weeks ago. He pops up in the final of the Europa League [in 2013], too. He really is a top player for the team. Itâs a desire and hunger heâs got, and the aggression and strength to want to get in those positions and out-strength the opponent.
âHe was one of the lads who hadnât trained since Everton. There have been a few of them. One or two turned out for the cameras [on Monday]. Thatâs what itâs about at this time of year, players digging deep. Weâve been lucky until now with injuries and niggles but everyone got through the game okay and weâve got a bit of time after the Burnley game, but first weâve got a massive three points to get at the weekend.
âWith us playing Spurs the following weekend in the final, thatâll be an opportunity for Manchester City to close the gap, so itâs really important that we pick up points against Burnley. Theyâve shown away to City that theyâre fighting. Where we are and they are in the table means nothing. Weâll certainly be up for it.â
