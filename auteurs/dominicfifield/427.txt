The manager has named a radically changed selection for the game at Estádio Mineirão, with Luke Shaw and Ross Barkley to gain their first competitive starts and Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Ben Foster drafted into the defence.
Frank Lampard will captain the side on his 106th and potentially final appearance, with the veteran midfielder echoing his managerâs calls for the team to show their character, as well as potential, against the group leaders.
Hodgson was in emotional mood as he confronted his teamâs final involvement at the tournament in Brazil. Asked what he learned from Englandâs briefest stay at a World Cup finals in 60 years, he said: âIâve learned how painful it is to build up your hopes and to see a lot of good preparation proved to be to no avail because it didnât get us where we wanted. Iâve realised that, although I probably knew this before, at this top level in a âThis last game will tell me a lot about the players. Itâs been a very tough few days and itâs hard to pick yourselves up for a game that, even if you do well in, serves no purpose. The 100-cap players will find that hard, so it will be unbelievably difficult for the youngsters.
âWeâll learn a lot about them in this game. Iâve liked what Iâve seen around the hotel and in training over the last few days, and Iâm now giving them the opportunity â not because I can but because I believe this side is a good team on the field and they can go and win the game. I hope they prove me right.â
Lampard, like the permanent captain Steven Gerrard, will take his time before determining his future at this level but Hodgson hopes the 36-year-oldâs experience will help inspire and reassure in equal measures against âThey can show the faith and hope we have in those boys is not misplaced and that they are ready to make their mark,â added Hodgson. âThis could be the first moment they give us an inkling that we are on the right track.
âWhen youâre at a World Cup and donât realise your expectations and hopes and have to leave the tournament, that final game is inevitably the one that leads you into the future. But we have a lot of time to think about the future. We have a long qualification campaign ahead. Euro 2016 is a long time away. For our young players there are two years of club and international football to be played.
âThis is a game against the top team in the group, the team who have exceeded all expectations with their results and the quality of their football. We have to show we can compete with this team. And itâs a chance to show our fans that we still have a lot of pride in our performance. Itâs a great opportunity for these players. Iâm handing them an opportunity to go out on a fantastic stage and show theyâre not only players of potential, but they are ready to play on this stage now and wonât let the team down.â
