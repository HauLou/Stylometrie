Rooney, who spent periods on both flanks during the Group D defeat by Italy in Manaus, is expected to revert to the central No10 role in São Paulo after training at length back in the middle on Tuesday. The position he plays in the team has drawn the focus over recent days given his relatively peripheral display at the Arena Amazônia, despite providing the assist for Englandâs equaliser, though his team-mates believe he can influence the side effectively regardless of where he plays.
âWe should appreciate the work rate Wayne put in â he covered a lot of ground against Italy â and the quality of the ball for the goal,â said Lampard.
âWhen he cut inside and shot, if it goes the other side of the post we would all be cheering. He is an exceptional player, as we all know. If we are going to go and do well in this âWayne can cover different positions. I loved him up front as a striker for âHe can do the left role as well. It is difficult. Sometimes you have to adapt to circumstances. I know if I was asked to play on the left or the right, I would do it happily for my country â I might not get the same rave reviews but that is the way of the world.
âIf you get results and win games, you will be happy. Wayne has played on the left in Alex Ferguson teams and got very good results away from home in Europe. People might have looked at how he played but, when the team gets the result, you move on to the next one. You can over-analyse the positional thing a bit.â
Rooney has 39 goals from 93 games but has yet to score at a World Cup, though Lampard â who was in the England squad for the strikerâs debut against Australia back in 2003 â does not believe that statistic is weighing heavily on his team-mateâs mind. âI donât think heâs necessarily thinking about that,â he said. âHeâs quite an unselfish player. Of course he would love to score but the way he plays and the way he is â heâs a creator of goals as well as a goalscorer. Ideally, yes of course he would want to score a goal but Wayne takes as much pleasure from creating goals as scoring them.
âHe hasnât needed a gee-up. Of all the players Iâve met in an England shirt, Wayne is one of the toughest. I remember him coming into the dressing-room at 17, warming up, getting his kit on and going out and just playing. He still plays with that mind-set. On the training ground, in the games, he has been the same.
âIâm not picking the managerâs team for him but Wayne is a very tough boy. Top players understand the focus. They understand what comes with it. Itâs great and then some negativity comes along.â
Lampardâs own role within this side has changed in recent years, with the midfielder, who turns 36 on Friday, a squad player and an unused substitute on Saturday. However, his influence as vice-captain remains significant. The veteran joined the England manager, Roy Hodgson, and the captain, Steven Gerrard, in addressing the players in a meeting called on Sunday evening at their Rio hotel as they attempted to draw a line under the defeat by the âWe had to put the game to bed,â Lampard said. âThere were a lot of good reports, and rightly so, but I donât want to be part of a team which had great potential and put in a good performance but then went home. Nobody wants to do that.
âWe are under no illusions what the next game is about. It was very important Steven and I said the same because weâve been there and gone home earlier than weâd wanted before, so we wanted to really take stock now and stress thereâs a cup final coming up. We had four or five days to get ready for it.
âItâs different for me. Obviously I want to play, but Iâm aware Iâm not always going to start and I will be turning 36 at the end of the week. Iâm under no illusions. Playing at club level, Iâve not played every game in the last couple of seasons. But you just adapt and, when youâre part of the squad, you help other players around you, train well, try and set an example and add your voice to meetings in the dressing room. If youâre called upon you have to be ready to play at your best.â
