The Symons will take charge of Saturdayâs visit of Blackburn Rovers to Craven Cottage after Felix Magath was sacked on Thursday with Fulham bottom of the Championship with a solitary point from seven games to date. The former West Bromwich Albion and Norwich City managers Steve Clarke and Chris Hughton have already expressed an interest in taking the job, with Tim Sherwood and Danny Murphy also understood to be under early consideration for the role.
Khan, who bought the club from Mohamed Al Fayed 14 months ago, is seeking advice from more experienced figures within the game ahead of making an appointment. âAs Kit Symons takes the reins as our caretaker manager, I will personally lead the search for our next first-team manager,â said Khan, writing in his programme notes for Saturdayâs game against Rovers. âTo address the obvious question as to whether Kit will be in consideration, the answer is yes. But this will be an exhaustive, thorough and deliberate process. No decisions will be made for the sake of deadlines or convenience.
âI plan to summon a number of qualified advisers for input, some within or close to the Fulham family and others who will bring a perspective from outside the club. In the end the decision will be mine, but the choice will be made with the benefit of excellent and highly respected counsel.

âBut, theyâre learning and, as weâre reminded with each match, the Championship is a rugged league. I believe our squad has competed fiercely. We saw that on Wednesday night at Nottingham Forest [when the visitors lost 5-3], and I anticipate weâll see it against Blackburn Rovers. But Iâm also reminded of a quote from Bill Parcells, the legendary Hall of Fame head coach in American football, who once said: âYou are what your record says you are.â
âThatâs an unfortunate and unacceptable reality of our season to this point, which is why I made the decision on Thursday to make a managerial change and part ways with
