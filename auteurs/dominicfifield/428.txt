Steven Gerrard has insisted the young players in Englandâs World Cup squad will not be scarred by their toils in Brazil despite the national side having failed to emerge from the group stage of the competition for the first time since 1958.
The Liverpool midfielder, who will make a decision on his own future at this level over the next few weeks, is convinced that the likes of Raheem Sterling, Ross Barkley and Daniel Sturridge are mentally strong enough to cope with a traumatic campaign.
Luke Shaw, Ross Barkley and Phil Jones, meanwhile, will start the final group match against Costa Rica on Tuesday with Frank Lampard to captain the side in what is likely to be his final international appearance.
âItâs a difficult one because the âUnfortunately, they live with you for a long time. The players have to accept that, cope with that and try and move forward and try and make sure they do everything in their power that if theyâre selected for another tournament their experiences are a lot better than the one we have just experienced.
âI do think the youngsters here have that character. Iâve said how talented they are. What I see from the young lads is that they work hard. They all do the right things in and around training and playing, and I think they want to stay at this level for a long time. That is the optimism I have got that it will be better in two years because of the standard of players we have here.â
Shaw will step in for Leighton Baines at the Estádio Mineirão after the Everton left-back suffered a hamstring injury. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlainâs hopes of appearing at the finals are over after he jarred his right knee in training â the Arsenal midfielder had been recovering from a medial ligament strain in the joint â and he will sit out the final group game before âLosing Alex [in the Ecuador friendly] was a blow,â said Hodgson. âWeâve been fortunate to go through the tournament and the preparation with so few injuries. This morning he had a slight recurrence of the knee problem and will now be out. The hamstring injury to Leighton Baines has ruled him out, too. We lost a couple of players before we came who would have been serious contenders to be with us. But Alex was very good against Ecuador and we thought we had a player who could make an impact.â
