The clubâs second offer amounts to around £14m for a player capped 15 times by France; an initial bid nearer £12m was rejected. The French clubâs squad are undergoing something of a revamp after failing to qualify for next seasonâs Champions League; this failure prompted an automatic wage drop for players with Payet, 28, due to lose around £12,000 a week.
André Ayew and André-Pierre Gignac have left for Swansea and the Mexican club Tigres respectively under freedom of contract while the midfielder Giannelli Imbula is attracting interest from Italy. The Marseille coach, Marcelo Bielsa, had hoped Payetâs deal would be renegotiated but the temptation of a move to England â after Everton had previously shown interest â is believed to have turned his head.
A four-year contract has been offered with terms of around £70,000 a week. Payet can operate across the front line as well as in a No10 role and contributed the most assists in Ligue 1 last season. He would join the Spain Under-21 international Pedro Obiang, who moved from Sampdoria to Upton Park for £4.6m. The West Ham board is anxious to demonstrate ambition to the new manager, Slaven Bilic, before the clubâs final season at the Boleyn Ground.
The need to reinforce is increased by West Ham competing in the Europa League, via the fair play rule. The draw for the first qualifying round takes place todayon Monday and their competitive season will begin on 2 July. Interest is retained in Barcelonaâs Alex Song, who spent last season on loan at West Ham. The Catalan club are seeking around £5m for the midfielder, who was impressive over the first half of last season, though there is a reluctance to meet that fee.
Meanwhile the Monaco midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbiathe Monaco midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia is set to disappoint clubs in the Premier League and sign a five-year contract at Internazionale after the clubs agreed a fee of £22m for the France international.
Both Arsenal, against whom he excelled in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 fixture last season, and Tottenham Hotspur have tracked the 22-year-oldâs progress but the only firm bids were submitted by Inter and their rivals, Milan. Kondogbia, a France international, is due to undertake a medical on Monday today before completing his move.
