That term had been coined after the nationâs defeat by Uruguay in the 1950 final in Rio de Janeiro, an implausible 2-1 defeat that sent shockwaves through the game, though this seemed as ludicrous a script. The team had arrived at the stadium in a coach bearing the slogan âBrace yourselves: the sixth is comingâ, and Scolari had suggested after their progress to this stage, maybe mischievously, that they had one hand on the trophy. That tenuous grip was ripped away by ruthless opponents.
For the moment the stuffing has been knocked out of the nation. To have been embarrassed like this, German players gliding through and away from yellow shirts with such staggering ease, may prompt Brazilians to turn their back on the remaining games and all those pre-tournament social tensions are likely to be revisited in the few days that remain.
The wave of protests had been simmering around the fanfests while Scolariâs side progressed. Now every reminder of the Perhaps the build-up had proved too much of a distraction. Brazil had become obsessed by the loss of Neymar, their talismanic striker and most potent attacking threat left broken by Juan Camilo Zúñigaâs challenge up in Fortaleza against Colombia last Friday. Everything in the lead-up to this occasion had revolved around how this team would cope without the 22-year-old, a team and nation emotionally distraught to the point of mourning.
David Luiz and César had held aloft Neymarâs No10 shirt prior to kick-off as the locals bellowed out the national anthem, the words hollered into the early evening sky with such passion that it felt as if the arena shook with the ferocity of it all. By then the Brazil players had discarded the white baseball caps, each bearing the message âForca Neymarâ, that they had sported at jaunty angles on arrival at the ground.
Yet, as was exposed so mercilessly throughout, it was not the loss of Neymar that was truly damaging. Rather, it was the second yellow card of the finals and subsequent suspension accrued by the captain, Thiago Silva, for needlessly attempting to block David Ospinaâs attempt to clear last Friday. The Paris St-Germain defender had virtually conducted the pre-match warm-up out on the turf here before taking his seat in the stands to witness his team unravelling from the sidelines, shock etched across his face as Germanyâs goals rained in. This mess of a defensive display will have done wonders for his reputation as an organiser and reader of the game, so hapless were the rusty Dante and a panicked David Luiz at the heart of the hostsâ rearguard. Neither full-back offered any sense of surety. Yet that will be of no consolation for Thiago. Deep down, he should surely feel culpable for his absence.
The manager, too, might concede plenty of this shambles was self-inflicted. Perhaps Scolari had sensed the nation needed him to be bold to shrug the locals out of their pre-match gloom, hence his decision to pick Bernard â a former Atlético Mineiro player and adored in these parts â from the start rather than mirror the Germansâ midfield trio to offer his back-line more protection. Paulinho, Luiz Gustavo and Fernandinho might have choked some of those flowing, rat-a-tat exchanges mustered by Joachim Löwâs side at source. Instead, outnumbered, Gustavo looked lost and Fernandinho wilted, his game disintegrating as he laboured to cut out Toni Kroosâs passes or Khediraâs movement. Or, indeed, that of Bastian Schweinsteiger, Mesut Ozil or Thomas Muller. The theory that Oscar might influence the contest more readily from a conventional No10âs role mattered little when the ball was smuggled so easily from befuddled team-mates who stood little chance of stealing it back.
As the chastening experience went on, so the localsâ mood grew uglier. Fredâs rare touches were booed, as was the Germansâ sixth which was constructed and converted so simply by Philipp Lahm and André Schürrle as to suggest no lessons were being learned. The seventh actually prompted ironic applause. This was a team craving an escape. The Maracanazo was a dark day in Brazilâs history. This Mineiraoazo will be just as painful.
