Roy Hodgson has expressed fears that money-flushed Clubs in the top flight spent around £835m this summer, with 80% of those transferred not eligible to play for England. Hodgson drew encouragement from the moves secured by âI donât think we should interpret the fact clubs are buying foreign players as meaning they donât have faith in the English ones,â said Hodgson when asked about the huge trade in foreign talent into the Premier League before Mondayâs deadline. âThere are plenty here in my squad even the top clubs would like but maybe they canât afford them or theyâre not for sale. The major problem is the pathway. Our academies are doing some good work, some good players are going through those academies and the bulk of those are English.
âMy fear is weâve seen players come through in the past who were very good at breaking into the Under-21s and getting a sniff at the first team and, when a vacancy in the seniors came along, through a player being sold or injured, theyâve been given a chance. But now, with the money the clubs have at their disposal, they are always going to be tempted not to take the chance they would have done in the past. If a player was out for a month or two a while back and they had a kid called Wayne Rooney or David Beckham, theyâd say: âHe looks pretty useful, letâs stick him in.â Now I fear theyâll say: âLetâs keep him back a bit longer and buy a top-class foreign player.â
âSo where are these guys going to play? If theyâre really going to be Wayne Rooneys or David Beckhams, thereâs no guarantee that Championship football will push their careers forward in the way playing Champions League or Premier League games is going to do. That makes it even more important for us to take good care of the ones we think are going to do something, and retain faith, like we did with Danny Welbeck, who didnât have many games at United. That we keep pushing. We have a commission. Thatâs looking into pathways that could help English football. Letâs see if they find the answers. But if there was a simple answer to it, a clear path we should be following, weâd be doing it.â
The England manager was asked about Cleverley, who had been a key member of his side until falling out of favour towards the end of last season. The United midfielder completed a season-long loan move to Aston Villa on Tuesday after it became clear his opportunities would be limited but he was apparently reluctant to seek a permanent move â and potentially a less lucrative contract â away from Old Trafford.
âItâs the cleft-stick situation,â added Hodgson. âWhen you find yourself at a top club like United, and youâve played for United and are on a good contract, itâs not easy to move to another club. Youâve got to find a club who will give you a similar challenge and be the right vehicle for your talent. And, anyway, a lot of these clubs think theyâre too useful to let go, given the number of games you have to play: Premier League, FA Cup, Champions League. You fall between two stools: too good to let go, not good enough to get into the team.
âThe biggest bonus for Danny Welbeck is for him. When youâre a player of his calibre and you find yourself at United, where competition for places means you donât always get the starts youâd like, itâs good for him to get the chance now of more playing time. Iâm pleased for him. I select him all the time, so I think that Arsenal have signed a good player.
âBut my job is with
