The 20-year-old Belgian has spent the last two years out on loan, at West Bromwich Albion and now Everton, developing his game with regular Premier League football. He has mustered 12 top-flight goals in 24 appearances for Roberto Martinez's team this season to suggest he should be given a chance at Stamford Bridge, where his brawn and pace would be reminiscent of Didier Drogba in his pomp. Yet Mourinho has yet to be convinced he is ready to spearhead a title pursuit and has already hinted that, like Kevin De Bruyne, Lukaku may yet be sold at a considerable profit with FFP in mind.
Another 20-year-old who has enjoyed a prolific season first with MK Dons in League One and, more recently, with Derby County in the Championship. The former Nottingham Forest academy graduate is still raw but is clever in his movement, strong in the air and a fine finisher to suggest he has a fine future at the higher level. Next season will be too soon for him to hope of making his mark at Chelsea, but he is highly considered at his parent club and will glean opportunities in the years ahead.
