Mesut Ozil felt compelled to leave The Germany international's club-record arrival has provoked thrilled anticipation at the Emirates Stadium, with Theo Walcott saying the signing had pepped collective confidence, whereas Ozil's former Real team-mates reacted with dismay. Alvaro Arbeloa described him as "a phenomenon" while Sergio Ramos summed up the mood at the Bernabéu, even in the wake of Gareth Bale's £86m arrival, by claiming: "If I'd had a say in the matter, Ozil would be one of the last players to leave."
The 24-year-old Ozil admitted surprise that the transfer had transpired having not envisaged departing the Spanish club. "At the weekend I was certain I would stay at Real Madrid but, afterwards, I realised I did not have the faith from the coach or the bosses," he said in an interview with the German football federation's website. "I am a player who needs this faith and that is what I have felt from "I am really looking forward to it because I have the faith of the coach. I had spoken to him at length on the telephone, he explained his plans and that he has faith in me â that is what I need as a player. I am looking forward to the new challenge. I have already heard that they have super fans, the city is great and the team is fantastic.
"[Arsène] Wenger gives me the faith and I can develop further. I know what I can do and I know that I could make the grade with any club in the world because I am so convinced in myself, but if I don't feel people have faith in me, then that is why I had to leave. At Arsenal, I feel I have this fully. I am sure the new coach is going to develop me further and I am also really looking forward to playing in the Premier League."
His new team-mates, bolstered by Sunday's north London derby victory against Tottenham Hotspur, are revelling in the high-profile addition to their number. "The likes of Ozil coming into the team will only boost our confidence," said Walcott, who had watched the drama of transfer deadline day unfurl while at the England team hotel at St George's Park. "He will hopefully bring the best out of the players and I'm personally really looking forward to it. With the amount of assists he has for club and country, it will help my game.
"He is a massive player, someone who has played for Real Madrid and Germany, and he's only 24 so he's reaching the top of his game. It will be another big boost to the club after such a great result at the weekend. He has shown it for his club and country for many years now and I think it is an absolutely fantastic signing. Just look at his record and the assists he has got. I played against him for the Under-21s back in 2009 when we lost 4-0 [in the final of the European Championships] and he showed his qualities then. He's a great addition."
