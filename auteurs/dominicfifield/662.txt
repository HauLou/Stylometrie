Swansea City are confident they can deflect interest from rival Premier League clubs to secure Blackpool's much coveted England Under-21 winger Tom Ince. The club's manager, his father Paul Ince, has confirmed that talks are ongoing with Swansea, whose interest was first expressed last summer, with a fee of around Â£4m mooted. The 21-year-old is out of contract in the summer, when his departure would generate only a compensation fee for Blackpool, and could yet choose to see out his current deal in the hope that other opportunities open up for him at the end of the season.
