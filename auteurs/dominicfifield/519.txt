Chelsea will have John Terry, Samuel Eto'o and Eden Hazard fit and available for the second leg of their The goalkeeper strode out into the Surrey drizzle with his team-mates just a week after dislocating his right shoulder during the goalless draw at Vicente Calderón in the first leg. The injury is still expected to rule Cech out for the remainder of the season â there remains the possibility he will undergo surgery â and he appeared to be carrying the arm awkwardly as he participated in jogging drills and stretches, with the 31-year-old clearly unable to swing the limb freely.
Cech retired along with Mark Schwarzer, Hilário and the youngster Mitchell Beeney to work with the goalkeeping coach, Christophe Lollichon, but watched on from the sidelines as the three others underwent their routines. Schwarzer, who excelled at Anfield on Sunday in Cech's absence, is expected to retain his place against Atlético with Hilario, who has not played a first-team game since August 2011, his back-up on the bench.
The return of Hazard, Eto'o and Terry does, however, represents a major boost for José Mourinho, who has lost Frank Lampard and Mikel John Obi to suspension for the second leg. Hazard â the 17-goal forward who was voted young player of the year by the Professional Footballers' Association on Sunday â suffered a calf strain during the 2-0 victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the previous round and has not featured since, and will offer a much-needed spark of creativity to the team in what is expected to be a tight return fixture.
Eto'o has been restricted by a minor knee complaint and was not involved at Liverpool, but should start against the Spanish club. All 12 of the veteran striker's goals for Terry's return is also most welcome, with Mourinho having initially feared he would be without his captain until the final in Lisbon on 24 May, if Chelsea qualified, at the earliest after he rolled his ankle in Madrid. The former England centre-half, who has enjoyed a resurgent season, had cut a disconsolate figure on the return flight home, but he trained on Monday and was moving freely at Cobham again on Tuesday morning.
His restoration to the side could have implications for Ashley Cole, who has excelled since returning to the side at Atlético but may now be sacrificed with César Azpilicueta returning to left-back and Branislav Ivanovic, suspended for the first game, at right-back.
Nemanja Matic and Mohamed Salah, who are both cup-tied, joined Lampard and Mikel on the training pitch with both Tomas Kalas â excellent at Liverpool â and Nathan Aké involved in the session.
