It was Wilshere had been moved to seek out Arsène Wenger in the belief that, if he could not secure proper involvement with the first team, his chances of featuring at a first major finals would disintegrate yet again. âI was panicking a bit about the squad, I wanted to be in it,â he said. âI thought I was ready but he said: âNo, youâre not. You need to train alone if you are to have a good Arsenalâs manager has a reputation for championing the clubâs cause above that of any national set-up but by reining in Wilshere he has provided the 22-year-old with his opportunity.
Wilshere has played only 42 minutes of competitive football since Englandâs friendly victory over Denmark in March. That was the evening he broke a foot, the fracture sustained in a 12th-minute challenge with Daniel Agger which eventually forced him off the pitch just before the hour. He played 27 minutes in the 2-0 victory at Norwich City on the final day of the season and the second half of extra-time in the FA Cup final win against Hull City but that is the extent of his recent game-time.
The optimist in Wilshere would argue he will be fresh for Brazil, though some rustiness is inevitable. He will surely feature at length against Peru in a bid to rediscover his rhythm and zest. âNow I just want to play,â he said, though that has been his message for some time.
However, the real test for Wilshere may not have been the six-week recovery from the broken bone. It may actually be what awaits in the next few weeks, when he must prove to Roy Hodgson that he should play a significant role in the team in Brazil.
His international career has rather stuttered along as a series of tantalising cameos, ankle and foot problems checking his progress while others staked their claims. He featured in only 144 minutes of Englandâs qualifying campaign, though memories of his fine display against Brazil in a 2-1 friendly victory in February 2013, 20 months after his previous international start, still serve as the benchmark. His tally of 15 caps in almost four years says much.
âBut I think a good World Cup can erase a lot of doubts,â Wilshere said. âIt is about the team and, if the side has a good World Cup, you are going to look good as a player. Itâs up to the manager if I play but Iâd like to think if Iâm on the pitch Iâll have a successful World Cup: having an impact, playing well and keeping the ball. If someone had told me four years ago I would be going to a World Cup now, I would have been happy with 15 caps and this chance. To have played only that number of games is disappointing but I have to look to the future and hopefully I can contribute.
âI just wanted to be here. I would have been devastated to have missed out and I knew the work I had to put in. If I got here, I could prove to the manager Iâm ready. Iâd like to think he saw enough of me throughout the season and knew what I could do if I was fit. Both Roy and Gary Neville got in contact during those six weeks, which was a big thing for me. The manager said I had time to get fit and to make sure I did and that weâd have chat then.â He has since been awarded the No7 shirt, news which beeped through on his mobile phone as he relaxed on a sun-lounger in Portugal last week. For a player who idolised David Beckham as he grew up, that has served to boost confidence further.
Hodgson would have to find a way of incorporating Wilshere into the centre having generally preferred the security of two anchormen behind the youngster, a tactical tweak that has potential implications for Daniel Sturridge further upfield. Yet there is actually a position up for grabs alongside the captain, Steven Gerrard, in deep-lying midfield which he will feel he can claim as his own, perhaps ahead of Jordan Henderson, if he proves form, fitness and a sense of discipline in the games against Peru, Honduras and Ecuador.
Prior to the squadâs departure for Miami, where the last two of the warm-up games will be staged, Wilshere will be among the contingent of
