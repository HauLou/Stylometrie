The ramifications of the points shed in this arena will not be as drastic for José Mourinho as they were for his predecessors as Chelsea manager, though that will offer the Portuguese scant consolation in the wake of a wasteful stalemate. Where Chelsea's advantage at the top stands at two points after this draw, secured late for West Brom by Victor Anichebe, and they could be overhauled by both Arsenal and Manchester City on Wednesday â a reminder of the pressure of life as leaders. Tensions had surfaced even before the substitute's flick to Saido Berahino's centre three minutes from time, with Branislav Ivanovic livid and booked for dissent after Anbion had pinned When Albion are whipped up into a frenzy, as in this last quarter, it is baffling to contemplate that they have won only once in 16 matches and are separated from the bottom three only by goal difference. At least they will have gained conviction from their late rally, with some belief to carry them into the weeks ahead when they confront five teams around them in their next six matches. Chelsea, by contrast, have suffered a reality check. Top they may be, with memories of a saunter against a depleted Newcastle and that eye-catching victory at the Etihad stadium still fresh, but momentum is checked. This was evidence to back up the manager's publicly expressed caution whenever the title race has been mentioned over recent weeks.
He confirmed as much afterwards with his observations about "a little bit of a lack of personality" and a reminder that "a ready team, a complete team, kills this game, 2-0, goodbye. We didn't." This was more troubling than the recent goalless draw with West Ham. They had peppered Adrian's goal then, to the tune of 39 shots without reward, and had been baffled by their inability to prevail. It seemed a freak result, a surreal evening capped by Mourinho's criticisms of the visitors' "19th-century football" and Sam Allardyce's chuckled riposte that the Portuguese was talking "shite".
This, though, was decidedly less fluent. Less becoming of prospective champions. They had rather run aground in the opening period, stifled amid the clutter flung down by Albion through the middle and blunted by that familiar lack of a cutting edge up front. Even Eden Hazard, who has been unstoppable in recent weeks, was peripheral.
Chelsea may have controlled possession but they only occasionally posed a threat and the lead plucked by Ivanovic in stoppage time at the end of the first half came unexpectedly given how drab the contest had been up to then. It was more a consequence of West Brom's concentration wavering: Chris Brunt lost David Luiz at Willian's corner, Ivanovic was permitted to charge into the six-yard box and Albion were breached.
The complexion of the game should have changed in that split second, the onus suddenly on Albion to pour forward and Chelsea thrilling at the prospect of biting on the break. And yet the prescribed script went awry, Ben Foster stood firm in the 15-minute passage when the visitors were dominant and panic eventually set in. The home goalkeeper was incensed by the substitute Fernando Torres and appeared to invite the Spaniard to prolong discussions in the tunnel once the players had departed the turf at the end. Tempers were frayed. This is the pressure Mourinho had suggested some of his younger players â not Torres, presumably â might struggle to brush off.
They certainly appeared riled as a collective, rattled by the ferocity of Albion's late assaults and infuriated at their inability to impose authority on the occasion. Mourinho spoke of defenders dropping too deep â this was not an inexperienced back-line â and a wastefulness in midfield.
The biggest difference between this match at The Hawthorns and the win at the Etihad was that the hunters had become the hunted. Chelsea had been playing catch-up since September; now they have been asked to set the pace. That brings its own kind of pressure and, in an arena which has proved a graveyard for their recent managers, it ended up overwhelming them. This was a reminder that they are a work in progress, not champions elect.
