Chelsea have entered into talks with José Mourinho had entered the January window anticipating no major business, having declared his satisfaction with a squad who have lost only twice in all competitions this season and remain in the hunt for silverware on four fronts. Yet, while Chelsea had hoped to add a right-sided forward of established talent next summer and had made known to Fiorentina their interest in Cuadrado, one of the key players in Colombiaâs fine 2014 World Cup campaign but whose form has been patchy in Serie A since.
They have moved in the past 48 hours to sound out Fiorentina over the possibility of bringing the deal forward by six months in the acceptance that a sale of Salah or Schürrle would necessitate the immediate purchase of a replacement.
The move is born of Romaâs increased desire to secure Salah, most likely on an loan deal with a view to a £12m transfer, with the Egypt winger having made only six Premier League starts since joining from Basel a year ago and having little future at Chelsea.
Inquiries from Wolfsburg and The 26-year-old, a £17.6m signing from Udinese in the summer of 2013 and capped 37 times, is contracted until 2019. Talks between Chelsea and Fiorentina have quickly established Cuadradoâs £26.8m buyout clause would have to be triggered if a deal is to be concluded. The player was included in the starting lineup for Wednesdayâs Coppa Italia tie against Atalanta and remains in their plans for the immediate future.
Cuadrado â quick, strong and skilful â would appear a natural fit on the right side of Chelseaâs attacking trident, with his credentials confirmed by his summer exploits in Brazil where, with James Rodríguez at his side, he contributed a goal against Japan and four assists.
It remains to be seen whether Schürrle, an £18m signing from Bayer Leverkusen 18 months ago and a player who has contributed useful cameos this season but denied a regular run in the first team, would be keen on returning to the Bundesliga with More appealing to Schürrle may be a move to Dortmund, though their interest is likely to crystallise in a summer bid once the future of their Germany winger Marco Reus has become clear. Chelsea have monitored Reusâs position but there are numerous suitors, making Cuadrado a more realistic target.
Thibaut Courtois has said Chelsea can win a clean sweep of European and domestic honours. âMyself, Costa, Filipe, Fàbregas and the rest of the team want to win trophies for Chelsea,â the goalkeeper said, listing the summer arrivals.
âThat starts in the League Cup to the last game in the Champions League. We want to win everything. It will be difficult but I think we have the team to do it.â
