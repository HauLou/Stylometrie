The 26-year-old has spent time on loan at Yeovil Town this season having lost his first-team place to Carl Ikeme and, when offered the chance to return to the Wolves side on Friday after the latter broke his hand, he rejected the chance to play at Gillingham.
That has left his relationship with the League One club strained despite the player apologising to the manager, Kenny Jackett, on Monday. He may be permitted to leave, though only at terms acceptable to Wolves.
The Palace manager, Tony Pulis, hopes to strengthen his squad significantly during the current window with reinforcements through the spine of his team. His current No1, Juli√°n Speroni, is out of contract in the summer.
