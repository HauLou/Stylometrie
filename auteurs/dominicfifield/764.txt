In the end, Ian Holloway was a broken man. He sat, ashen-faced, in a cinema theatre in the basement of the Soho hotel and all that fizz and exuberance that had marked him out, not least on the touchline at Wembley less than five months ago, had drained away. This time the faded buzzwords were "exhausted" and "tired". "This club needs that impetus of energy," he offered, "but I just feel pretty worn out."
It was a fatigue that dulled the reaction as Crystal Palace slumped through that limp second-half display against Fulham on Monday, the team floored by the pair of jaw-dropping volleys from Pajtim Kasami and Steve Sidwell that had provided the latest painful reminder of the chasm between the Championship and Premier League. An unfamiliar Palace team that bore little resemblance, in personnel or spirit, to the side that claimed the play-offs in May had succumbed to a fifth successive defeat.
Holloway duly offered his resignation in the immediate aftermath in a lengthy meeting with the co-chairman Steve Parish. He would do so again having eventually concluded his media duties that night but, for all that the hierarchy insisted he sleep on the decision, there was no coming back. Once the manager, as brutally honest as ever, had made it clear he had lost his sparkle and that his chaotically assembled squad were effectively questioning his focus, a parting of the ways was inevitable.
"The way I care is a tad unusual," Holloway said. "I believe I could sell a fridge to an Eskimo if I believe that myself. That's what helped us get to the Premier League in the first place." But the stuffing had been knocked out of his own conviction.
There was an inevitability about aspects of all this. Palace may have made fleeting visits to the top flight over the last 20 years but, as welcome as a guaranteed injection of £140m into the coffers must be, they were not really ready for elevation. Certainly not in terms of their infrastructure, at least. On the pitch they were a weaker team the day after the play-off final with the departure of Wilfried Zaha, the precocious homegrown talent who was sold to Manchester United in January for £15m and loaned back for the remainder of the campaign, and with Glenn Murray, their 32-goal top scorer, out until the new year with a cruciate knee ligament injury sustained in the play-offs.
After years toiling in the second tier they boasted no real scouting network to pinpoint upgrades for the players they possessed, leaving manager and co-chairmen poring over videos until the small hours of potential recruits they had never previously heard of. Normally they would have shopped from the free transfer list or bought youthful promise from the lower leagues. Now they were operating in a very different market. Parish described the summer as "ridiculous". "Three years ago we didn't own our football ground, we were bankrupt, we didn't own our training ground, and we had five first-team players on our books," he said. "If we'd had a better infrastructure in place we'd have been able to do more for him and wouldn't have been up watching players until 4am every night."
Parish's assertion that he would have been "quite happy to get relegated and come back up with Ian" felt incongruous given the recruitment drive that did kick in. There were 16 new arrivals before the deadline, including five on the final day, of whom two â Stephen Dobbie and the French full-back Florian Marange â did not even make the 25-man Premier League squad list that had to be submitted in the first week in September. The likes of Owen Garvan and Peter Ramage signed new contracts but did not make the cut. In those frantic weeks, Palace merely succeeded in eroding the team spirit that had propelled them to an unlikely promotion in the first place. They have already used 24 players in eight matches this term, and some of the stalwarts have been unimpressed with the attitude of those who have come in.
"We tried to change too quickly," said Holloway. "It's really important that you keep your dignity. With the changes in the squad I have to hold my hand up: we didn't keep that spirit that got us up, we lost some very important parts of it. Some of the new lads, their attitude and where it is, I'm finding it slightly annoying and that ain't right. I didn't like the second half [against Fulham]. I like to inspire and help people and what I'd say at half-time would normally spur people on, but it didn't. I knew straight away. I'm not saying players are not good enough, but they need to buy into this club like the last lot." There is nothing like shoddy results on the pitch to expose cracks in a club.
Holloway would once have backed himself to re-energise a flailing operation. He would have had the effervescence of character to hoist the mood of those around him, but his summer offered only a five-day respite to catch his breath â and even then he was on the phone to Parish each night â before an elite campaign was upon him. "Last week I was out building up the energy of the club but maybe I've not got the energy left to take on and stop, or even beat, Arsenal this weekend," he added. "I'm just tired. I miss my grandson. I just need some time to chill out."
There were handshakes with co-chairmen and board members alike as he departed, but his sense of numbed disappointment was clear. A week ago, Roy Hodgson had reflected upon England's qualification for the World Cup finals in his own media conference across the hallway at this hotel. This time the mood was rather more sombre.
