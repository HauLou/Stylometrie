The hope must be that this is as awkward as their two-legged tie with Besiktas gets. Arsène Wenger and his club have an unblemished record in qualifiers for this competition, with all 12 of their play-off matches over the last eight years having been won, taking in contests with sides from Zagreb to Prague, Glasgow to Enschede. They were in Istanbul this time last year, enduring Fenerbahceâs initial surge of aggression before their own quality told rather more emphatically. Even so, âThe group still needs to grow. But every game you win makes you stronger and helps gain confidence. We have won matches recently and weâre more positive at the moment but the reality of the competition is itâs about performance. The environment doesnât count for anything. We were not completely happy with our performance last Saturday against Crystal Palace and we want to improve tomorrow.â
Alexis Sánchez and Santi Cazorla may enjoy more space in which to thrive with the onus on Besiktas to make inroads and Aaron Ramseyâs form makes him a potent threat. With Yaya Sanogo having remained in England with a slight thigh problem, Olivier Giroud will lead the line.
Arsenal have scored eight goals on their previous two visits to Istanbul, though the locals will not be too perturbed. Besiktas are relishing life under Slaven Bilic, a man who won friends here with his crestfallen and emotional reaction to Croatiaâs quarter-final defeat by Turkey back at Euro 2008. The former Everton and West Ham defenderâs reputation suffered over his short and unhappy spell at Lokomotiv Moscow but he has since found a home from home, a club whose young side shows considerable promise. They have the former Chelsea trainee Gokhan Tore, Kerim Frei, recently of Fulham, and the former Arsenal academy player Oguzhan Ozyakup in their number. âThey say Besiktas have 15 million fans in Turkey, and they expect,â said Bilic. âWe have a dream and we will try our best to realise it. We are ready and we will never give up.â
A first appearance in the group stage for five years at Arsenalâs expense would represent a startling achievement but they are clearly a team on the up. They might have won the domestic title last season only to slip away at the last but their line-up has since been supplemented by Demba Baâs arrival from Chelsea, the Senegalese offering a focal point up front after a frustrating 18 months in south-west London. Ba had pushed to join Arsenal a year ago but Chelseaâs reluctance to lend him to a perceived title rival scuppered the deal. He has maintained the upbeat form from the back end of last term to date, registering a hat-trick on home debut to secure passage beyond Feyenoord in the third qualifying round. That has made him an instant hit and a player of whom Arsenal should be wary.
In that context Wenger will be buoyed to have Laurent Koscielny fit enough to play, his compatriotâs achilles problem having eased to allow Per Mertesacker to remain behind to continue his own preparations for the new campaign. To that end the potential defensive crisis really extends no further than Kieran Gibbsâ hamstring injury which will keep him out for up to three weeks. The rest of this line-up looks familiar, even solid. âWe didnât know where we would land,â added Wenger, âbut it worked well and we landed where we wanted.â The manager will hope his team follow suit by progressing into the group stage.
