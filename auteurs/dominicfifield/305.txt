It is a little after half past five on Monday evening and Steadman Scott, perched up on a five-foot partition which divides the main sports hall of Brixton Recreation Centre, is surveying his community. About 30 children, mainly from the surrounding estates of Moorlands to Angell Town via Loughborough but clad in football shirts from Arsenal to Barcelona via Manchester United, are drilling in three age groups, taking it in turns to trap, spin and sprint. Painstakingly fine-tuning the basics. Scottâs eyes flit from one to the other, the coach occasionally barking encouragement from his vantage point but forever on the lookout for mischief, ill-discipline, lapses in concentration. The parents at the far end of the room are hushed.
Welcome to Afewee Academy, a nonprofit organisation staffed by volunteers where children from five to 16 are trained, educated and inspired. There are grassroots schemes up and down the country which have become local hubs, coaxing quality from the next generation of talent, but Afewee can claim to be different. From these sessions, on midweek evenings in the hall or weekend afternoons on the 3G pitch downstairs, over 30 young players have been scouted and recruited by professional clubs.
Their number includes Sean Scannell, once of Scott, in partnership with his fellow coach Tony Goldring, has been overseeing this project for more than 16 years with his reputation well-established locally. He has worked on community projects for Palace, Fulham and Arsenal, initially visiting schools to run coaching clinics but also encouraging those he unearthed to attend training at the Rec. The £1,500 annual hire of the hall was met in that first year by a friend who owned a car wash business and âwanted to give something backâ. There was a period subsequently when Arsenal funded the costs and even had an office on site. So panicked were Tottenham Hotspur at the conveyer belt of talent emerging from south of the river that they informally hired the room next door to ensure they, too, boasted a presence. Of late, and after much lobbying, there have been grants from Lambeth council to help sustain the programme independent of club influence, even if Afewee are still reliant on donations. âOur loyalty isnât to individual clubs who can discard players they donât want to pursue,â Scott says, âbut to the community.â
Clyne followed Scannell and Blackman into the Rec. âI picked him up in Somerleyton, a very vicious block of flats where the boys use guns,â Scott says. âA gang place. The police were paying Fulham at the time to run a summer programme keeping kids off the street, so I went to Hill Mead School for them and there he was: this little boy, really good on the ball, very quiet, very competitive. A good attitude. I told him I was looking for a bunch to come up the Rec and work so, when a club comes looking, I can show them the best boys we have. When he was 10 I sent him up to Arsenal for a trial. He was a winger at the time and I told him: âTake on players, score goals. Donât go thinking youâre there to have a good time, son. Youâre going there to make an impact. Itâs one chance.â
âHe came back and told me heâd scored four, but Arsenal reckoned he was too small. I still remind them of that when their scouts come down: we sent you Nat and now youâd pay a lot of money for him, and heâs just knocked you out of the [Capital One] Cup. Spurs had a look at him, along with Zaine [Francis-Angol, currently at Motherwell], and liked him. But a while later Scannell, who was at Palace by then, told me: âClyneâs up here and really shocking out the youth team.ââ He would go on to play 139 first-team games for the London club before launching his Premier League career with Southampton.
His progress is a source of pride, not only for Corie Andrews and Mandela Egbo, following in the full-backâs footsteps from Afewee to Palace, but for all those who have tracked his progress since. This community club is not simply intent on offering distraction to keep Brixtonâs young off the streets. It is also geared towards giving them something to which they can aspire: a target, a focus, a dream. Lambeth is the eighth-most deprived London borough, with the Rec slap-bang in the middle of Coldharbour ward where the poorest areas are concentrated. The children who attend Afewee grow up around violence â between 2011 and 2013 there were more shootings in Lambeth than any other part of the capital â but give them a sense of self-esteem and a chance of fulfilment and theirs is a thirst to succeed.
âThe first thing I say to a kid when he comes âupstairsâ is: âWhat is your dream?â If itâs not to be a footballer, donât step over the line. Our community is at the very bottom, killing themselves off at 12 or 13 with guns, drugs, the lot. We have to find something to make them dream because the kids here who donât have hope end up in gangs. Middle-class kids witness success every day, but the children here donât see that. We have to teach them how to be winners, how to interact. I want to prepare their minds, their bodies, to make sure they understand they have to take instruction and follow rules. I shout at kids. Iâm harsh. I want to see if they want it. Theyâre not here to have fun â this is Brixton, thereâs âfunâ all over the place â so itâs my way or the highway. A bit like [Sir Alex] Ferguson would say.
âIn one sense, yes, I am comparing myself to Ferguson. The rate of success proves that. How many other voluntary organisations have a similar record to ours? Our duty was to build a bridge between the community and the top clubs. Now that bridge is built. We have a boy in every London club. We have 12 senior players, and over 30 with scholarships. But this is about education. For everyone who comes here, I am the king. Parents bring their kids here just for discipline. It is strict. But there is no bullying. Even the weakest kids can express themselves here. We want them to show controlled aggression. Without that they wonât make the grade. Footballâs a team game, but first of all itâs about the individual. Youâre competing all the time to hold off your competition. I train them mind and body so that, when they go to a professional club, the coaches see theyâre well-groomed, winners who work their socks off, asking for no favours. That gives them a chance.â
At times Scott tears into the youngsters, if not quite in full Gunnery Sgt Hartman mode but still pretty close. There are flashes of Full Metal Jacketâs infamous drill instructor in the way he reacts to those who dare to answer back. Yet the sense of respect between youth and coach is clear.
Before the class, as he sat in the cafe, a constant flow of participants had approached the 58-year-old to offer a shake of the hand in welcome. The parents seemed far warier, but the youngsters are enthused, their mentorâs charisma infectious. Lucia Marte Leon, a teenager from Spain who signed for Spurs Ladies last year, spoke of âsomeone who pushes and pushes, but only for your benefitâ. âThis is where I learned self-discipline,â says Requaan Russell, who went from Afewee to Fulham and, after suffering a serious injury, is reviving his career at the local Kinetic Academy. âSteadman is like a second father to me. Heâs not in it for the money. He just wants to see you doing well for yourself and making a career out of football.â
The coach has his own reasons to pour heart and soul into this project. He served time in the 1990s, with many of those with whom he had played five-a-side still on life sentences. Some were members of the 28s, a Brixton gang from that era. âIf an opportunity like this had been there back then, a lot of those boys wouldnât have chosen that path,â Scott says. âI had to rebuild myself. When you have a criminal record you have no self-esteem, but I learned in prison I had to have a focus on something I was passionate about. I needed it, so itâs not only for the boys. Thatâs why itâs called âAfeweeâ â¦ âItâs for usâ in Jamaican slang. Everything you touch is yours. A community thing. Itâs for all of us.â
That is why he is constantly pushing for more funding, more space in which to coach, more ways to inspire, and therein also lies a frustration. Of the 30 boys and girls who have gone on to professional clubs from Afewee only Blackman â a player whose lavish talent has never truly been realised over a nomadic career that has already taken in spells at Arsenal, Celtic and, most recently, Blackpool â has returned to speak with the current crop. âThe reason we founded Afewee was to create role models, mentors in our community, because we donât have them,â Scott says. âWhat Iâm hoping is that, with so many boys from Afewee playing top level, one or two will come back and see us. Iâd say to them the community helped you up there. You know the problems we have. You know our young people have gone astray. One footballer coming down here would make a massive difference.
âYou have a duty to come back and share your experiences. Itâs a chain. It will give these kids dreams. Guys like Clyne can inspire. They have a responsibility because their community, where they grew up, is still in danger. One day they will come back and talk to the kids, show them what can be achieved. It will happen. But we wait. A kid we have at Brighton called me the most inspiring person in this community recently and that is everything. Seeing Clyne playing for Clyne should be proud of his elevation. Back at Brixton Rec, they are glowing to count him as one of their own.
