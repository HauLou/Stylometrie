Chelsea will not entertain any offers for Hazard was culpable in his failure to track the marauding full-back Juanfran in the buildup to Atlético Madrid's equalising goal at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday as the London club departed the Champions League. The 23-year-old, who has drawn considerable praise over a season in which he has scored 17 goals, has attracted interest from Paris Saint-Germain but will remain an integral part of this side as Mourinho seeks further evolution.
The Belgian had told French television after the loss to the Spanish that "Eden is the kind of player who is not so mentally ready to look back at his left-back and leave his life for him. If you see Atlético's first goal, you understand where the mistake was and why we conceded that goal. The perfect team at the top level cannot make this kind of mistake. Eden's not the kind of player ready to sacrifice himself 100% for the team and his team-mates. I'm not happy [a player doesn't sacrifice himself], and I've spoken all season and I've tried to improve him. But at the same time, his comments were not critical."
Hazard, who appeared rusty returning from a calf injury for the second leg against Atlético after a three-week absence, has made considerable strides this season and taken on more defensive responsibilities in his game. Indeed, it is understood Mourinho spoke with the player after the loss to the Spanish and warned him of his intention to address his comments, made to beIN Sports, and his progress in Friday's media briefing.
"He's had a good season, and made an improvement," said Mourinho. "He was brought to a different level of performance and understanding of the game. Remember the performance at Manchester City, which was a very complete performance. So I have no problem with him. He's a young guy. His evolution was fine. Does he still make mistakes? Of course he still makes mistakes. But he understands. It was the first time in his life he'd played a Champions League semi-final. It's a career that's he's just started."
Yet there was an admission, too, from the manager that pragmatism had driven his own outlook over recent weeks as he chose to postpone the development of the team's style of play to ensure they met their objective of qualifying for next season's Champions League as well as staying in contention in the domestic title race. That switch was made in recognition of his own side's lack of a prolific goalscorer. "I knew what I was doing," said Mourinho. "At a certain moment of the season I made the decision to stop that evolution in the style and philosophy of play and went in the direction I felt was the only way, with these players, we could get results.
"I felt this Premier League â more than the Champions league â was so dangerous because of the risk for the big teams to be out of the top four. Reaching the top four in the Premier League at this moment â it's not a cup, I don't want to get a bonus for finishing top four, no way, no way ... the moment I think like that I'm in trouble ... but the reality is this "We had lots of matches, and long periods this season, where we produced excellent football but we weren't the killer profile. We'd built certain bases which we need to recover next season, especially when we have this little, little transformation and improvement in our squad that we need. We need to go back to these bases that we worked and developed during most of the season. I adapted. The team became more strategical and less intuitive from a certain point of the season because we went for results. There are moments when you have to go in a strategical way if you want to compete for what we were competing for."
