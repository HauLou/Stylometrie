Kane nodded in Raheem Sterlingâs cross with his third touch at this level, the third-fastest goal by an England debutant after Bill Nicholson in 1951 and John Cock in 1919, to complete the scoring in the 4-0 win. Wayne Rooney had earlier registered his 47th international goal and Danny Welbeck, who is a doubt for Tuesdayâs friendly in Italy with a knee injury, added his sixth goal in five qualifiers this season as âIt was a very satisfying evening for us and fantastic for Harry,â said Hodgson. âWeâre so delighted for him. It is a bit of a fairytale, but itâs nice when fairytales come true, and itâs come true for Harry. Heâs crowned his âThereâs been a lot of pressure and hype around him and itâs fantastic that, in the time he was on the field, he made a good run to the back post, Raheem Sterling produces a bit of magic and Harry scores a great goal. We hope thatâs the start of a great career for him. I think Harry will put pressure on himself because heâs a good professional, but I donât think heâs a person whoâll buckle under pressure.
âHeâll have to accept the media spotlight, which has already been enormous, will only get bigger, but heâs in good hands with Mauricio (Pochettino) at Tottenham Hotspur and with us here. Weâll make sure we donât build him up to knock him down, but build him up to be a big part of our future. He is still a young man, but what could be better than making his debut and scoring a goal?â
The Lithuania manager, Igoris Pankratjevas, described Kane as âa sniper, a great strikerâ, with the player himself departing the turf still pinching himself. âItâs not a bad start, is it?â said the striker, the 17th player to score on his England debut. âI dreamed of this as a kid, and itâs all a bit of a blur at the moment. Itâs the best moment of my career. To represent my country at senior level is the top but, hopefully, this goal is the first of many.â
England are braced for withdrawals from their squad over the weekend, with Sterling â who scored their third goal â to return to Liverpool to undergo an injection in a long-standing toe injury, and James Milner to have a scan on a knee complaint. Leighton Baines will be replaced by Southamptonâs Ryan Bertrand, while Welbeck hurt his knee just before his substitution and is expected to withdraw. âIt was a tweak to the knee,â added Hodgson. âThe medical staff gave me the impression theyâre not terribly worried about it, but that Tuesday may be too soon for him to feature. But weâll see.â
England have now won all seven of their games since the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and continue to lead Group E by six points. âSince the World Cup we have been fantastic,â said Rooney.
âWeâve had some great victories, are scoring goals and we have real energy around the team. A lot of teams will be looking at this team around Europe and will be frightened.â
