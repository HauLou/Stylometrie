Manchester Cityâs reward for securing progress from their Champions League group is another meeting with Barcelona, who beat them last season, also in the knockout phase. Cityâs sporting director, Txiki Begiristain, described the draw, made on Monday, as âunbelievableâ. The teams met at the same, last-16 stage last season, Barça prevailing 4-1 on aggregate.
Another of the English qualifiers, Chelsea, were also drawn against familiar opponents. The Premier League leaders have been paired with Whereas José Mourinho and Wenger had expressed a wish before draw in Nyon to meet those respective opponents from Ligue 1 City face the daunting prospect of taking on Barcelona again. They and their frontline of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suárez are due at the Etihad Stadium for the first leg on 24 February. âIt is unbelievable,â said Begiristain, a former Barcelona player and director. âWe donât need to talk because, every time, it is the same: âWe have plenty of confidence, though, because of beating Bayern, and Roma away, and we have players to recover and come back so we will arrive in a good moment. We have improved our squad since last season, we are more solid and stronger at the back. We have more confidence for this game.â
Manuel Pellegrini, who took unfancied Villarreal to the semi-finals of this competition in 2006 and Málaga to the last eight, will hope Sergio Agüero and Vincent Kompany have fully recovered from recent injuries to feature against Luis Enriqueâs side, though Yaya Touré will miss the first leg in Manchester as he serves the third game of his ban for a dismissal against CSKA. The Barça sporting vice-president, Jordi Mestre, said the tie would be âa very hard match as Manchester City are a very tough team to beatâ.
PSG, still second by a point in France despite suffering their first league defeat of the season at the weekend, will pose another stern test for The west London club will be reunited with their former centre-half, David Luiz, at Parc des Princes on 17 February. The Brazilian left Stamford Bridge for a fee of around £50m last summer. The defender was in the Chelsea team beaten 3-1 in Paris in last yearâs quarter-final first leg, scoring an own goal, but Chelsea won 2-0 in the return game, with a decisive 87thâminute strike from Demba Ba, to progress on the away goals rule. The PSG president, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, welcomed the chance for revenge and suggested he was âvery confidentâ. âWe learned a lot from the experience last year,â he said. âAnd we will be working hard to make sure there is a different outcome this time round.â
Despite the prospect of facing Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Edinson Cavani and Ezequiel Lavezzi, who was so impressive in last seasonâs tie, there is conviction at Chelsea that they are better equipped to triumph in the Champions League this season, having reached last seasonâs semi-finals. âLast year we were close and we didnât have the team playing at such a high level as we do this season, so we can dream we will do it,â said Mourinho. âBut letâs see if the sharks let us because there are a few sharks in the ocean.â
Wenger will take Arsenal to Monaco, where he spent seven years as manager before leaving in 1994 having claimed one French league title and a French Cup and reached the Cup Winnersâ Cup final, in 1992. Monaco currently languish sixth in Ligue 1, though they beat Marseille, the leaders, on Sunday and scored only four times to top Group C. The draw was a relative relief for Arsenal given they played, and were eliminated by, Bayern Munich at this stage in the last two seasons. Arsenal have never met Monaco in a competitive fixture, though Radamel Falcao scored the only goal in a game at the pre-season Emirates Cup last summer.
The French club will be without their influential midfielder Jérémy Toulalan for the first leg in London through suspension and the In the other ties Real Madrid will play Roberto Di Matteoâs Schalke while Bayern Munich face Shakhtar Donetsk. âWe are certainly favourites against Shakhtar,â said the Bayern chairman, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, âbut we will go there with great respect in these games. This is definitely a new experience for us.â Basel, who knocked Liverpool out at the group stage, play Porto, Juventus will take on PSG v Chelsea
