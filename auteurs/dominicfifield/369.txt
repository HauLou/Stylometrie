Andros Townsend could be left on the fringes at Spurs have not disguised their wish to reunite Schneiderlin with Mauricio Pochettino at White Hart Lane but Saints, having already sold several key players, have made it clear that they wish to retain the France midfielder whom they consider key to the tactical system to be employed by Ronald Koeman at St Maryâs.
Their reluctance to do business has exasperated Tottenham and may have implications for Townsend.
The winger signed a four-year contract last season, having enjoyed a fine autumn and made his mark with Roy Hodgsonâs England squad. However, his form tailed off and he missed the World Cup with England after suffering an ankle injury.
His position at Spurs is now unclear. He was used for 29 minutes as a substitute in the opening weekend win at West Ham United, but was not involved in the 18-man match-day squad for Sundayâs 4-0 victory over Queens Park Rangers.
Townsend is conscious that, unless a move can be negotiated in the next week, he may end up playing only in cup competitions and the Europa League with Nacer Chadli, Christian Eriksen and Erik Lamela having impressed under Pochettino.
