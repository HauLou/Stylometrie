Then, two years ago and in the afterglow of Chelseaâs Champions League success, he was pushed while running at full tilt into his on-rushing goalkeeper, Joe Hart, by Belgiumâs Dries Mertens in the final friendly before the squadâs departure. The collision cost the centre-half a tooth, a double fracture of the jaw and another summer on the periphery. In that context, his livid reaction to Luis Ramírezâs seventh-minute shove in the back as Hart charged out again during the recent Wembley win over Peru was understandable. âEarly on, wasnât it ... I just thought: âWhatâs going on here?ââ said the centre-half. âI canât think about the Belgium injury. That was bad luck as I was about to get on the plane.
âBut the fact this is my first tournament does make it all more special. I have waited a long time to get here. Iâd been an outside shot before the blood clot at the previous His progress, from the periphery at Aston Villa to a Brazilian World Cup via loan spells at Burnley and Sheffield United, a productive career at Bolton and a glittering stretch at Chelsea, has been eye-catching. Having been originally called up in the summer of 2009, he had endured a lengthy period as Englandâs go-to back-up man, a squad player who was rarely required. âBut that was part of my progression to where I am now,â he said.
These days he is a mainstay for club and country, a centre-back who has sponged knowledge and experience from John Terry at his side at Stamford Bridge and offers solidity in partnership with Phil Jagielka in the Cahill, at 28, is at his peak, having just enjoyed his most consistent domestic campaign. He is a European Cup winner, a Europa League winner, and a defender who has confronted and nullified elite strikers regularly in the Champions League.
His presence in Roy Hodgsonâs side should be a source of reassurance. He has also dealt with the pressure associated with life at Chelsea, progress that has bolstered his status with England. âIâve worked on my game, listened to people and taken advice on board,â he said. âIâve taken bits from each manager Iâve worked under, and from top players who have been there and done it. Positionally, reading the game, Iâve come on a lot. Thatâs one of my strengths now, where Iâve most improved.
âBut itâs all about concentration levels. In international football the pace can be a lot slower than in the Premier League, which is right up there in terms of its tempo. You donât have too much time on the ball at club level, but in international football there is a step up in players. You are playing against the best in the world. Iâve played games where Iâve come off at the end and thought I was unbelievable out there for 87 minutes and then, all of a sudden, Iâve switched off once or a cross has come in and theyâve scored. That wrecks your whole game. You canât just forget about it. It goes through my head, I replay incidents like that a lot, and you want to go straight back out and play the next game. Itâs about learning, about concentrating.â
The centre-back will need to do that in the steamy heat of Manaus, where the perilously erratic but potentially brilliant Mario Balotelli awaits. âYouâre never sure what heâll do, and thatâs dangerous because youâre not sure if he will turn up or not. Heâs got the potential to stick it into the top corner from 30 yards, an unpredictable player but, on his day, one of the best. I came up against him at Manchester City a couple of times and he was tough, but in one of those he came off at half-time. So, yes, unpredictable. But he can be world-class at times.â
The same might be said of David Luiz, a defensive colleague and team-mate at Chelsea until his recent sale to Paris St-Germain. Cahillâs excellence this season â as well as the £40m fee on offer from the French champions â influenced the decision to sell the Brazilian. It was, in effect, a vote of confidence in the Englishmanâs impact. âDavid is a fantastic player, and good luck to him,â Cahill said. âPeople donât pay that sort of money for average players.â
Cahill cost £7m from Bolton back in January 2012 as his contract entered its final six months. An impressive World Cup would merely reinforce the sense that Chelseaâs bargain is now very much a pillar of this England side.
