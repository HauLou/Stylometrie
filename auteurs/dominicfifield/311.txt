The £32m signing from Atlético Madrid has scored eight goals in six Premier League appearances but has struggled to play twice in four days after complaining of tightness in his left hamstring. Costa had withdrawn from the Spain squad for their qualifier against Macedonia last month having tweaked the thigh in a friendly defeat by France and José Mourinho has argued that the 25-year-old needs a complete rest over the forthcoming international window, something he feels he cannot grant amid the clutter of early-season club fixtures, but felt compelled to start him against Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday despite the player having started against Aston Villa three days previously. Costa will be assessed at Cobham before Arsenal visit Stamford Bridge but is adamant he will be able to play against Arsène Wengerâs unbeaten side.
Asked if he would feature on Sunday, Costa replied: âOf course. Iâm certain. I played 90 minutes in Lisbon and now I can have a rest. I do not see a problem. To have played 90 minutes suggests I am OK. Every time I play I feel better and it is a decision for the manager the best way to recuperate from the injury. During the week I am working intensively with the physios but [Mourinho] asks me regularly how I am to make sure I am in the best possible shape. The injury is not so bad. I will keep working to return to complete fitness.â
The forwardâs involvement in training has been limited at times since moving to Chelsea and the club are aware of the hamstring issues which affected him over the run-in to last season and frustrated his impact in the Champions League final. âThere are days when I do not train so I can prevent problems, as a precaution more than anything, but there are other days when I can,â Costa said. âIt is a matter of communication between me and the medical staff to find the best way possible to move forward and get over the problem.
âEvery day I feel better. There are a few niggles that are annoying me and ideally I would be training every day but I am working to treat the problem during the week and every day I feel closer. Things are improving. Normally I try to forget it during the games so it does not inhibit my performance. It does not enter my head. It is a negative way of thinking and I try to avoid negative thoughts, not just with this but in life in general. You are just thinking about playing in the best way, not worrying about what might happen.â
Mourinho has made clear his frustration that Costa is expected to link up with âI think it is something that cannot happen,â he said when asked if there would be an issue between Spain and Chelsea. âThere was already a war with the Brazil issue and now I need to be left in peace to try and do things well for the national team. That is what I need and hopefully I will be in this next squad.â
