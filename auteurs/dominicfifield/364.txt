Neil Warnockâs first act on his return as Palace have confirmed Warnock on a two-year contract as the successor to Tony Pulis, who departed 36 hours before the clubâs opening fixture of the season. It is the 65-year-old Warnockâs first position since leaving Leeds United last year. He comes back to the club where he spent almost three years before departing when Palace slipped into administration and were handed a 10-point deduction in the Championship in 2010, with the clubâs co-chairman Steve Parish describing him as âa safe pair of handsâ after a traumatic and pointless start to the season.
The former Sheffield United manager has overseen only 58 games in the Premier League in total, but he was preferred to Steve Clarke after Parish held a second series of interviews this week.
Warnock is to determine whether the caretaker manager, Keith Millen, and the first-team coach, Ben Garner, are to remain at Selhurst Park. He will attempt to hire the Notts County manager Shaun Derry, who had two spells at Palace as a player, as a member of his backroom staff, with the co-owners keen to establish a clear order of succession at the club.
Warnock, whose first game back in charge will be Saturdayâs trip to Newcastle United, inherits a squad which finished 11th last season but before Zaha has had only three additions this summer â Fraizer Campbell, Brede Hangeland and Martin Kelly.
Zaha has made little impact at United after a £15m move from Palace in January 2013, but his return will please the fans. He was loaned back to Palace almost immediately by United and was instrumental in securing the clubâs promotion to the Premier League.
However, he made only two starts for David Moyes last season â in the Community Shield against Wigan Athletic and the League Cup against Norwich City â and was loaned to Cardiff City, who were relegated, for the second half of the campaign. The 21-year-old, who has two England caps, has failed to convince Louis van Gaal he is worth a role in Unitedâs set-up and he was an unused substitute in Tuesdayâs 4-0 defeat at Milton Keynes Dons.
Zaha, who was developed by Palace in their academy from the age of 12, is one of four arrivals expected before the deadline. It remains to be seen whether Warnock can persuade Jack Cork to complete a £3m move from Southampton, the midfielder having agreed to join when it appeared Malky Mackay was to take over at Selhurst Park, with a left-back and a striker also wanted. âThereâs plenty more work to do,â said Parish. âWeâve got the transfer window closing on Monday and I think he [Warnock] would want to bring a few in, so hopefully weâve got some more good news for supporters in the next few days.â
Parish had been close to appointing Mackay before details of offensive text messages sent by the Scot while managing Cardiff were made public. âMalky was someone who interviewed very well,â said Parish, who also interviewed Tim Sherwood as well as Clarke and spoke with Glenn Hoddle. âFrom a footballing point of view Malky was a very good candidate but unfortunately there were things that obviously meant we couldnât bring him to the club. It was impossible to offer him the job.
âIâve known Neil since the club went into administration. Funnily enough the first time I met him properly was when we flew to Newcastle the night we went into administration. Heâs someone who has always been helpful to me and offered advice, and heâs a safe pair of hands for us right now. I think heâs got unfinished business. Heâs got things he wants to prove to himself. He likes the club and has a lot of affection for the fans and he felt a good fit.â
Palace are confident there will be no lingering resentment between Warnock and the winger, Jason Puncheon, who had been fined £15,000 by the Football Association and warned as to his future conduct last season for comments made on Twitter following his former manager at QPRâs criticism of a penalty miss at Tottenham in January. âThereâs no way I wouldâve trusted him with a penalty,â Warnock had said on Talksport. âYouâve got to have somebody a little bit more cool, and heâs not like that, Jason.â The pair have since met face to face and cleared the air, with Puncheon set to continue as a key member of Palaceâs side.
