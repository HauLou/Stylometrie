Evertonâs hopes of signing Scott Dann are likely to be dashed with Dann, a £2.6m signing from Blackburn Rovers in January 2014, is contracted for a further two years at Palace but Yet Palace, who finished above Roberto Martínezâs side in 10th place last season, have not received a bid for their player of the year and will reject any offer, having determined the centre-half is not for sale at any price.
Pardew hopes to add up to four players to his squad in the close season to maintain the teamâs recent progress, even if fringe players will be allowed to depart.
An inquiry has been made by promoted Bournemouth as to the availability of Dwight Gayle. The striker, who joined Palace for an initial £3.5m from Peterborough in 2013, scored 10 goals last season to finish as the clubâs leading scorer, though only five were in the Premier League. He was not even included in the squads for the final four games, although Pardew, speaking last week, suggested the 24-year-old forward still has a future at Selhurst Park.
