As build-ups to a first top-flight fixture in eight years go, Crystal Palace's has felt rather fraught. Ian Holloway had persuaded Marouane Chamakh to swap Arsenal's reserves for a relegation scrap, but was denied a first look at the striker at training when the Moroccan retired to his sick bed. On Wednesday, the manager believed he had secured the England forward Darren Bent on loan from Aston Villa with a medical pencilled in; then radio silence, before a late-night telephone call from the agent confirmed the player was joining Fulham instead.
Friday did bring an arrival, the French defender Florian Marange signing on for a year to become Palace's new No3, but the sense is there has hardly been time to catch breath, with Tottenham Hotspur, a team who have broken their transfer record twice this summer for all the hoo-ha over Gareth Bale's future, due at Selhurst Park on Sunday. This squad is still being assembled, the campaign proper having rather crept up on the newcomers. "For a team coming up it's difficult, unless you've experienced it before and you're going to spend some money, like West Ham last summer," says Holloway. "They did fantastically well with Sam Allardyce's experience. But where West Ham are as a club isn't where we are. They've been here before so their expenditure is, well, 'woo-hoo'.
"We're trying to expand three years after being in administration, so what [the co-chairman] Steve Parish has got to cope with is off the planet. We're having a go, we'll get stronger, but I've got two weeks to pad out my squad and catch up with the others, and the rules suit them, not us."
Cue an admission that Palace are "sharks in the water" but surrounded by "bigger sharks", exasperation at the meddling of intermediaries claiming a mandate on every Tom, Dick and Harry in whom interest is expressed, and frustration that players' perceptions of the club have kiboshed other moves. "My chairman is learning already â he's a very clever man â that where Palace are in his mind isn't the same as where we are in the minds of all the agents or players we're talking to."
That this club begins the season as relegation favourites is almost accepted. Holloway may even use it as a motivational tool as he steels a team who, a year ago, had been expected to struggle in the Championship. But despite the slog recruitment has become, there are reasons for optimism. Wilfried Zaha's exuberance has been lost, but Dwight Gayle, a club record purchase for an initial £3.25m, is a rough diamond waiting to prove his quality at this level. The striker had yet to play league football 12 months ago, his promise manifested in a productive loan spell at Bishop's Stortford, but has since proved himself a natural finisher at Dagenham & Redbridge and, in the second tier, with Peterborough.
"He's on an upward curve, and the only 'risk' is that, if he scores goals, he might go on and play for England," says Holloway. "When Ian Wright came to Palace from non-league he ended up playing for England and being Arsenal's top scorer. Was that a risk? I've had to earn my living taking risks so if Dwight Gayle's a risk then I'm delighted I took it. He's hungry." Raw, quick and predatory, Gayle's addition reflects well on this team's future, however the immediate campaign pans out.
Then there is Chamakh, one of the more lavish arrivals, signed on an initial season-long deal. The Moroccan's star has slipped alarmingly since he was one of the most sought-after forwards on the market, fresh from propelling Bordeaux to a Ligue 1 title and making his mark in the Champions League. Those giddy first few weeks at Arsenal, with 11 goals in 22 games, seem an age ago now but, on a free transfer and a weekly wage understood to be around £36,000 with his deal across the capital paid up, he is another risk worth taking. "He's very good in the air, very elegant, moves nicely, he can do two or three things for me, drifting out wide or linking," says Holloway. "I just want to give him an opportunity to play.
"He was hot property for a while, but his biggest problem at Arsenal was Robin van Persie (recovering from injury), I would suggest. Rumours about his life and what's round it are just ridiculous. If I can get him scoring the world will be his oyster again." The 29-year-old once did that in six consecutive Champions League games. His arrival may have been greeted with suspicion by some, but there is pedigree there to be coaxed out. Certainly, starting against Spurs, Palace will look for the forward to fill the void left by the injured Glenn Murray whose 31 league goals last season were so key to the team's elevation.
The task ahead feels daunting. It will remain so even if the management succeed in adding a further quintet of new faces before the deadline â William Gallas has been mentioned, with defensive reinforcements a must â but this is a club still thrilled to be here at all. Reality may have dawned since that heady afternoon at Wembley in May, a hectic summer having allowed Holloway five days in Lime Regis as a breather, but this team confounded expectations by gate-crashing the party in the first place. Their enthusiasm will not be doused by the prospect of what is to come.
