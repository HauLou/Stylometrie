The former England captain Rio Ferdinand has been charged with misconduct by the Football Association for a tweet, posted on transfer deadline day six weeks ago, in which he used the slang term âsketâ.
While the charge announced on Tuesday, if proven, would most likely command a relatively minor sanction, the language used in the message was deemed inappropriate by the governing body. The Queens Park Rangers defender, who has until 21 October to respond to the charge, has recently been involved in the FA chairman Greg Dykeâs commission assessing how best to improve English football and was briefly considered by the governing body as a possible Fifa vice-presidential candidate until David Gill, the former Manchester United chief executive, confirmed his intention to stand.
Ferdinand, who earned the last of his 81 caps in June 2011, had responded to a user on the social media network who had written: âMaybe That term, retweeted almost 14,000 times in the period since, with the tweet retained on the defenderâs timeline, did contrast markedly with much of the abuse that duly poured his way â the first response suggesting âsupposed to be a role model ya cunt.â Another user followed up by asking âainât you supposed to be some sort of FA representative and youâre on twitter slagging mums off?â Regardless, the original message was deemed to be âabusive and/or indecent and/or insulting and/or improperâ with the breach alleged to be âaggravated pursuant to FA rule E3(2) as it included a reference to genderâ.

The player had followed up his tweet with another, 10 minutes later, which read: âDonât play the role model card here....take ya slaps!â which might have suggested this was more of a light-hearted exchange. Usually, off-the-field offences such as breaches of social media policy provoke fines as sanction, with Ferdinand having already fallen foul in this regard in the past.
The centre-half had been fined £45,000 for appearing to endorse a message in which Ashley Cole had been referred to as a âchoc iceâ in the fallout from the John Terry racism trial in 2012. An independent regulatory commission had found proven an improper conduct charge after Ferdinand replied: I hear you fella! Choc ice is classic! Hahahahahahha!!â
Users had subsequently begun discussing and reacting to the comments with Ferdinand adding: âAnd if I want to laugh at something someone tweets....I will! Hahahahaha! Now stop getting ya knickers in a twist!â
The commission determined the charge proven and suggested the breach âincluded a reference to ethnic origin, colour or raceâ.
