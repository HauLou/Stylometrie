José Mourinho is considering starting Costa, who began life at Chelsea with an eye-catching seven goals in four league games, was omitted from the Spain squad in last monthâs international window to rest after a series of persistent hamstring and groin complaints. He was suspended for the midweek victory over Tottenham Hotspur having picked up a fifth booking of the campaign at Sunderland and, while his threat and work-rate have remained a constant, the striker has only scored twice in his last seven outings stretching back to mid-October.
âFor me, the problem is not the goals â they will come as a consequence of his condition,â said Mourinho. âHe has to improve his condition. He was injured and had many doubts because he went a long time without training. Obviously that must have an effect on a player in the way he runs, the way he moves and in his co-ordination. I donât think there is any problem but he has to recover.â
An outing against Sporting, who are competing with Schalke for the runners-up place behind Chelsea, might offer an opportunity to sharpen his fitness with Mourinho expected to offer game-time to other fringe players such as Ramires, Loïc Rémy, Kurt Zouma and Filipe Luís. The Brazil left-back is the only player in the squad who is one booking away from a European suspension, though the club boast adequate cover at full-back. Nemanja Matic, who was suspended at St Jamesâ Park, may also sit out the game offering another opportunity to John Mikel Obi, while Petr Cech will return in goal for Courtois.
