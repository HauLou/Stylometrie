The Fàbregas played the whole of Chelseaâs Premier League victory at Liverpool on Saturday, having also featured for 90 minutes in the midweek Champions League draw in Maribor, but has been released from the Spain squad for their Euro 2016 qualifier against Belarus on Saturday and next weekâs friendly with Germany in Vigo. The 27-year-old was checked by the Spanish Federation in Madrid earlier this week and has since returned to Cobham for treatment.
âWe had to wait a few days to evaluate Cescâs injury and we opted for him not to continue with us,â Del Bosque told the Spanish radio station Onda Cero. âAt times we have been flexible but not in this case. His muscle seems all right but he complains and he is the best doctor. I prefer not to be deceived but I cannot be distrustful. When a player of his calibre tells you that he is injured, you have to believe him.â
Fàbregas joins another Spain international at âIn our previous training camp, he complained about pain in his pelvic bone,â Del Bosque said of Costa. âI thought it was best for him to take a break. âItâs not a sign of weakness, I donât want to confront anyone.
âWhen I gave my 23-man squad, I knew that Costa was going to play with his club at the weekend [at Liverpool]. But we cannot push someone when they donât feel completely well. He is the first one that has asked us to âplease not forget himâ when I make my next squad selection in February.â
Fàbregas will continue to be monitored by Chelsea, whose next game is against West Bromwich Albion at Stamford Bridge on 22 November, with the Premier League leaders reluctant as yet to indicate the extent of the injury heFàbregas has sustained. José Mourinho had admitted he had taken a gamble in playing the midfielder on Merseyside given that he already had the problem.
