Arsenal intend to push on with their pursuit of the Talks are continuing with the Spanish club over the fee required to prise away the 24-year-old, whose eagerness to swap El Madrigal for the Emirates Stadium has effectively forced Villarreal to consider offers lower than the £16m release clause in his contract. Securing the work permit will arguably prove more onerous. The player has not represented Brazil at any level and regulations for players without an EU passport state they qualify only if they represent an international team ranked within Fifaâs top 70 and have played 75% of that sideâs matches in the previous two years. There is scope for the rules to be relaxed â an appeals process is run by the Football Association on behalf of the Home Office â though Arsenal would have to prove that Gabriel, who does not enjoy dual citizenship, is an âexceptional talentâ who would benefit the game in this country.
There is confidence within the clubâs hierarchy that the panel could be persuaded of the playerâs pedigree despite the fact that, ideally, they would be paying only an initial £6m for his services. Arsenal are anxious to avoid repeating the scenario which saw them forced to loan Joel Campbell, of Costa Rica, and Mexicoâs Carlos Vela to clubs in Europe before securing the green light to bring the players to the Premier League.
Arsène Wenger does have potential alternatives should the FA block the move, with Espanyolâs Mexico international Héctor Moreno, who has 57 caps and has just taken on Mino Raiola as his agent, or Winston Reid of West Ham United likely candidates. The latter is out of contract in the summer but would cost in excess of £7m.
The need for defensive cover has been accelerated by the loss of Mathieu Debuchy for three months with a shoulder injury and Laurent Koscielnyâs achilles complaint.
Arsenal are reluctant to sanction Campbellâs departure this month having loaned Yaya Sanogo to Crystal Palace and Lukas Podolski to Internazionale.
