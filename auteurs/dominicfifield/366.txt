He had been given the honour of being the captain for what proved to be his final cap, against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte though, like the teamâs campaign, it all ended feeling disappointingly low key. Then again, a drab goalless stalemate in a meaningless fixture would hardly constitute a fitting sendoff at any level.
Just like those of Steven Gerrard, who had also effectively bowed out amid the anticlimax of the Mineirão, the numbers do make impressive reading. Lampardâs was a 15-year career in the national setup, beginning with a 76-minute display in a friendly against Belgium in October 1999 and, after a brief lull, taking in 106 caps and four major tournaments.
Only five players have made more appearances for He was influential, inspirational at times and, in the latter stages of his career, even a source of support both for He had acknowledged his responsibilities extended well outside the sphere of the training pitch, and the juniors in the squad should have been sponges soaking up every drop of advice offered by the experienced man. âFrank Lampard has been a superb representative of the English game, both as a player on the pitch and an ambassador off it,â Hodgson said. âTo reach in excess of 100 international caps is something very few professionals achieve and he is in exalted company. He has served the national team quite brilliantly during his 15-year international career.â
The frustration, just as with all members of the Golden Generation, is that the talent did not yield trophies at the highest level. For a player so dominant in a Chelsea side regularly plundering domestic and European honours, the criticism would be that, Euro 2004 aside, he never flourished at a major tournament in the manner his reputation befitted.
Those finals in Portugal a decade ago represented a high point: three goals in four matches, against high quality opposition in France, Croatia and Portugal, to earn a place in Uefaâs representative team. He was Englandâs player of the year in 2004 and 2005, a regular scorer in qualifying campaigns. And yet, when it came to the competition proper, too often his impact went nullified, unnoticed, with his threat suddenly blunted.
That exasperation was shared by the collective as much as Lampard alone but, just as with Gerrard, his prowess at club level heaped expectation on his shoulders. It is fair to say the World Cup never treated him kindly. He had arrived in Baden-Baden in 2006 as a Premier League winner and voted â albeit by some distance behind Ronaldinho â the second best player in the world by Fifa, only for his personal finals to degenerate into a series of wildly inaccurate attempts from distance. The shootout defeat to Portugal in the quarter-final saw him fluff one of only three penalties missed for his country.
Fast forward four years and there was that controversial shot from distance thumped on to the underside of the bar and scrambled from behind the goalline by Germanyâs Manuel Neuer. England should have equalised. Instead, with the officials non-responsive, they crumbled amid their smouldering sense of injustice, ending humiliated and eliminated. He had played every minute of the teamâs games in Germany and South Africa, and the entirety of that draw in Belo Horizonte. No one can match his 40 shots in the World Cup without one credited as a goal.
Therein, of course, lies his legacy. The linesmanâs oversight in Bloemfontein and the subsequent outrage at least paved the way for Fifaâs adoption of goalline technology. Even Lampard has admitted he âchanged the game for the betterâ, albeit through gritted teeth and with thoughts of what might have been achieved had England drawn level at the Free State Stadium.
Lampard would rather have been looking fondly back on silverware, not sensors in the goalmouth. âBut, if Iâm honest, I canât reflect on my England career with any real sense of disappointment,â he had added in Brazil. âI couldnât have envisaged playing even one game for my country when I was a kid, let alone 100 or more.â He will be fondly remembered as one of the best of his generation.
