Barkley was one of Englandâs bright young things in Liechtenstein in 2010 as Peacockâs team strode through their group, eliminated France in the semi-finals and Spain, champions in two of the three previous years, in the showpiece. The current crop waltzed impressively through their qualifying and elite groups, and won their first two group games in Malta to secure passage into the semi-finals. They stuttered last Thursday to surrender their final group fixture to the Dutch, Wednesdayâs opponents again, but displayed resilience and a cutting edge to overcome a fine Portuguese side in Sundayâs semi. A chance of silverware now looms.
There is pace and skill in this team, typified by Fulhamâs precocious talent, Patrick Roberts, a player who tasted life in the Premier League this season. The likes of Isaiah Brown and Adam Armstrong have caught the eye, the Chelsea forward Dominic Solanke proving himself an instinctive finisher, with the captain Ryan Ledson and his midfield partner, Lewis Cook, offering a central platform from which to build. The 18-man squad is drawn from 14 clubs, of which only four â Charlton, Middlesbrough, Leeds and RC Lens â are outside the top flight, yet the scouts have been scribbling their reports with interest these last few weeks. Peacock, as a seasoned youth-team coach, will rightly preach caution, but he has rare options with this year group.
âThere is strength in depth, and not every age group boasts that,â he said. âThere are similarities with the 2010 squad because we had strength in depth there, too. We had to bring players in late on in that competition and it didnât disrupt the teamâs rhythm. You do get generations. This age group has some very exciting front players. In others we probably donât have as many number nines or wide players as weâd like, but we have four or five, six probably, with us here. We are well blessed in that respect.
âBut this is also about the psychology of tournament football. Youâre into the âwin businessâ as soon as you hit the first team at club level. Thatâs what itâs like here, too: these lads have to learn how to win high-pressure games. Even in a small event like this â which is big in their young eyes â to see them playing in a semi-final, whether theyâve tasted first team or not for their clubs, is a massive challenge. How do they deal with the pressure? You canât buy that experience. I put on a slide show in the hotel before the Portugal semi-final which addressed three sections: managing yourself; managing the occasion; managing the game. If youâre feeling under pressure and constrained, youâll not perform. Theyâre talented players, but they have to deal with new things here: anxiety; pressure; expectation. If they do go up the ladder, these are what theyâll need to cope with.â
As much of Peacockâs role is about education as tweaking tactics, with those within the Football Associationâs setup acutely aware of the need to retain a sense of realism. Emulating Barkley may be the ideal but there is recognition, too, that he is an exception. A glance down the Jack Butland has since become the countryâs youngest senior goalkeeper at 19 years 153 days but, like Josh McEachran, Benik Afobe and Andre Wisdom, has spent this term largely on loan in the Championship. Conor Coady was lent by Liverpool to Sheffield United in League One. Luke Garbutt made one substituteâs appearance for Everton and Connor Wickham, whose winner defeated Spain in the final, only really demonstrated his undoubted abilities in the Premier League with any consistency over the last six weeks of term after loan spells with Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds.
Others nominated by Uefa included Gerard Deulofeu, an Everton loanee from Barcelona, Crystal Palaceâs José Campaña, Chelseaâs Tomas Kalas and Arsenalâs Yaya Sanogo. Valenciaâs Paco Alcácer has made his mark this term, yet only really Paul Pogba, now a key member of Didier Deschampsâ senior set-up, feels established as an elite performer four years on. âBut patience is the key,â said Peacock. âTo get an 18-year-old in a first-team environment in the Premier League is a tough task. The Wayne Rooneys and Theo Walcotts of this world are exceptional but we have a tendency to want it to be instant, for players to become consistent and the finished article overnight. Itâll never be that way. Theyâre 17. They may win this competition, but theyâre still learning their trade. They need opportunities to grow and develop. Going out on loan offers them that, but we still sometimes just discard talented players because we donât give them enough time.
âFor these guys to reach the level of, say, Ross is a massive challenge. Itâs not just down to talent: there are other factors, from social to psychological issues, and that ability to handle the pressure. This tournament is a chance for them to learn. I believe in every one of them. The Portuguese team were very talented, the best Iâve seen for about 10 years, and the Dutch are well drilled with good attacking players. But, regardless of what happens , our lads have gained the experience of reaching a European final, and that is priceless. Hopefully we can come out the other side as champions.â
