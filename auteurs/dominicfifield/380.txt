Arsène Wenger has warned his Arsenal players they face a stern test of character in Tuesdayâs awkward The Londoners will have Laurent Koscielny available for the game at the Ataturk stadium, where âThis is a big test,â said Wenger when asked what awaits against Besiktas. âWe had a short preparation and we know that in one week we have three big games: Besiktas home and away and Everton in between. Every challenge is different and beating a Turkish team away from home is very difficult but we want to perform at our best. Besiktas are on the back of a good result against Feyenoord [in the third qualifying round] but weâre on our toes and want to produce a good result.â
Progress would be worth around £20m to Slaven Bilicâs Besiktas are much improved, and bolstered by the signing of Demba Ba from Chelsea, as they attempt to reach the group stage for the first time in five years. The former Croatia manager admitted his side were up against âone of the strongest teams in Europeâ but said they had a game plan which could see them prevail. He will be heartened by the fact that they have won their last 12 games in Uefa qualifying as they attempt to eke out a lead to take into next weekâs return at the Emirates stadium.
Wenger, for his part, remains wary of the threat that awaits at a half-full Ataturk stadium. ââI have a good experience in the Champions League,â he added. âI know you have to be pragmatic and realistic and just go game by game. First we have to qualify. Itâs a very difficult task and we know we have two difficult games. Before speaking about anything else we know we have to put in two big performances against Besiktas.â
