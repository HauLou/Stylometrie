The Fulham have been told there is no guarantee they would succeed with a move for the 6ft 7in Brondby striker Simon Makienok. The club have been quoted a Â£3.3m fee and could try to sign the 23-year-old if, as expected, Dimitar Berbatov leaves.
Makienok's agent, Michael Stensgaard, said the Denmark international was in "no rush" to move.
