Moses, signed by Chelsea from Wigan Athletic last summer for £9m, has slipped down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge after the summer arrivals of Willian and André Schürrle, and Kevin De Bruyne's return from his loan spell at Werder Bremen. Brendan Rodgers had earmarked him as a potential recruit earlier this summer and, despite Chelsea's initial reluctance to loan the player to a Premier League rival, the Liverpool manager has now been given approval by the Europa League winners to pursue the deal. Moses was in Prague on Friday for Chelsea's defeat to Bayern Munich in the Super Cup final, in which he did not feature, but has made clear his desire to move to Merseyside â despite interest from West Bromwich Albion, Southampton and Everton over the course of the summer â and will complete the move before Monday's transfer deadline with the loan fee now agreed.
There is no option for Liverpool to make the deal permanent next summer, an indication that Moses could yet have a long-term future at Stamford Bridge.
The forward was nurtured at Crystal Palace's academy before moving to Wigan for £2.5m in 2010, when Palace had slipped into administration. He impressed under Roberto Martínez to earn a surprise switch to Chelsea last summer and played 23 times in the Premier League, while his goalscoring form flourished in the latter stages of the club's successful Europa League campaign.
Liverpool are reported to be interested in signing two defenders, the £15m-rated Mamadou Sakho from Paris Saint-Germain and Tiago Ilori of Sporting Lisbon, who would cost around £8m. The 23âyearâold Sakho has 14 France caps, while Ilori, 20, has been capped by Portugal at assorted age-group levels.
