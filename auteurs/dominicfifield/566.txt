José Mourinho intends to contest the improper conduct charge announced by the Football Association for re-entering the field of play in stoppage time at the end of last Saturday's defeat to Aston Villa.
The Chelsea manager was sent to the stands by the referee Chris Foy in the furore after Ramires' dismissal for an ugly foul on the home midfielder, Karim el Ahmadi. The Brazilian's tackle had prompted a mini pitch invasion from both dugouts but, once the coaching staff and substitutes had returned to the technical areas, Mourinho came back on to the pitch signalling for a "time out" and seeking to speak with Foy, only to be sent off.
Mourinho has until 6pm on Monday to react to the charge, which would see him fined around £10,000 if found guilty by a commission, but has indicated he intends to contest the decision.
"Yeah, I've decided: I don't accept the charges," he said. "I have to wait until Monday and work out what I will do. For you, it's enough to know that, for obvious reasons, I don't accept the charges."
It was the second time the Chelsea manager has been dismissed this season, following an incident during his side's victory over Cardiff City last October which saw him accept an £8,000 fine.
While this case is considered "non-standard" because it constitutes a second offence within 12 months, the misdemeanour would not result in anything more severe than a fine in the eyes of the FA if the Portuguese is determined to be guilty.
