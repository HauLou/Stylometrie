Paul Clement is set to turn down interest from Clement is a key member of Ancelottiâs back-room staff and has also won major trophies at Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain. His progress in Spain has been noted by clubs in England, with West Brom understood to have sounded him out over replacing the sacked Pepe Mel and Brighton seeking to ascertain his availability after the resignation of Oscar García following their failure to gain promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs earlier this month.
Their hopes had arguably been encouraged by the Englishman suggesting after the Champions League triumph over Atlético Madrid that the time was coming for the him to branch out on his own at 42, most likely back in England.
âI think itâs soon, it will be soon,â he had said. âWill it be England? I donât rule out anything. More than likely in England, although if a nice opportunity came up that was in another country I wouldnât rule it out. Iâve enjoyed working in France and Spain as well.â
However, after Madrid claimed their 10th European Cup in Lisbon, a victory which ensured Ancelotti will stay at the Bernabéu next season, the former physical education teacher from Sutton does now anticipate remaining in Spain for at least one more season.
