The France international, who has linked up with Didier Deschampsâ squad for the Euro 2016 qualifiers against Portugal and Armenia, had met the Southampton board on 29 July to make clear his desire to leave after three clubs, most appealingly Tottenham Hotspur, had expressed a desire to prise him from St Maryâs.
Schneiderlin had seen a number of first-team players sold in the wake of Mauricio Pochettinoâs defection to Spurs and, despite being under contract until 2017, felt the chance to move on was too good to turn down.
Asked if that meeting was heated, Schneiderlin told France Football: âYes. Those last few months there was interest from clubs for me â three of them, including Tottenham. From around February or March my agents Pascal and Sébastien Boisseau and me spoke with Southampton to smooth my departure. The club had always said theyâd sell me for the right price. We went to the meeting calm with the interesting proposals on the table. For me, after six years in Southampton and given everything I had given the club, I thought everything would be finalised on that day.
âI told them that I had signed up to a project that relied upon the club keeping its best players to keep progressing. But before that meeting, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Rickie Lambert, Luke Shaw, Calum Chambers had all left. I was asking myself: âThis isnât how it was supposed to be. What are they doing?â At that point Southampton hadnât bought anyone. Chambers signed for Arsenal on the day before our meeting.
âThe club then saw our fans were starting to freak out. The hierarchy said to themselves: âIf Morgan leaves, theyâll burn down the stadium.â Then the club told me and my agents: âMorgan is not for sale.â We responded: âWhat do you mean, not for sale?â They came back with: âWeâre not listening. Morgan is staying. This is the project. Thereâs nothing more to say.â It was a shock for me. I was asking myself: âWhy are you blocking me after all Iâve given to the club?â
âOf course I was angry. Iâd just come back from the World Cup, after two good years in the Schneiderlin, who had been valued at around £27m by the club, made his disaffection public by tweeting later that day: âSix years of an incredible adventure £saintsfc DESTROYED in one hour.â âIâm nice and measured but, if something makes me upset, Iâll say so,â said the midfielder. âIâm no longer a sheet. I fight for my interests, for my career. With everything Iâve been through, I know that there are opportunities that canât be missed. Thatâs why I was upset. After that meeting, and having seen the press release from the chairman [Ralph Krueger], I had to show I wasnât happy. Either I was going to go into the club and lob in a teargas grenade [he said with a smile], or I was going to make it clear in another way. I wanted people to understand the situation with my Tweet. In five seconds I saw how far social media stretches. It was like a bomb going off.â
The player had toyed with the idea of refusing to train or play thereafter, effectively going on strike, before resigning himself to spending the campaign ahead at St Maryâs and opting to knuckle down and work. âI talked with lots of people,â he added. âSome of them told me: âIf you want to force the issue, do it.â Some advised me to strike until late August, saying that in some cases the clubs ended up relenting. âItâs your decision,â they told me.
âBut I sensed from the hierarchy at Southampton that they were not going to let me leave. They would prefer to leave me lying in the gutter for six months, if necessary. So I started training, I tried enjoying my football again and I was made to play against Liverpool on the opening day. At Anfield all the Southampton fans applauded me and chanted my name. That warmed my heart. I knew then that I would spend the season here.
âI learned a lot from all of this â¦ In business there is no mercy. No one does you any favours. But Iâm not complaining about anything. I know Iâm very lucky. Iâm playing in a Premier League which is going very well. People appreciate me. Weâre playing well, we have great facilities. We could perhaps do something fantastic. Qualifying for the Champions League would be extraordinary. That would be a bomb going off in the English championship.â
