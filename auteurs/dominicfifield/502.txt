Yet, by the time he took to Twitter to confirm the end of an international career the like of which an England left-back has never previously known, that initial deflation had given way to realism. Cole was gracious in praise of the manager, wished his team-mates "only success", and lauded those who will replace him, Leighton Baines for now and Luke Shaw in the longer term, as "the future of this country". His hurt at having to call it a day reflected raw emotion. His recent run back in the These are tumultuous times for Cole. His whole season had been an eye-opener given that he was never a player used to enduring life on the fringes but, ever since he damaged his ribs in an otherwise comfortable victory at Norwich City in October, he has been scrambling to retain his lofty perch with club and country.
His future at Chelsea hangs in the balance, with the manager, José Mourinho, due to submit a written review of the season, in which he makes the case for the 33-year-old to be offered a new one-year deal with his current contract into its final two months, on Monday.
It is unclear whether the hierarchy at Stamford Bridge will be persuaded to retain the player, with interest expressed in Atlético Madrid's Filipe Luís and César Azpilicueta so assured at left-back since breaking into the team last November. The Spanish right-back usurped him on the left and excelled.
Chances have been so limited for the Englishman since then that his 350th league appearance at Cardiff City on Sunday was only a 15th start of the campaign in the competition. He wore the captain's armband in the 2-1 win in the absence of John Terry and Frank Lampard. "He was not captain to say goodbye in a nice way," said Mourinho after the match. "He arrived [at the club] before Branislav Ivanovic, so he was the one with more time. So I gave him the armband as a consequence of that. I don't know [if that was his last appearance], but I don't think so."
Time inevitably catches up with every player, but that prolonged period out of the Chelsea first team eroded his untouchable status within the When it came, against Atlético in the semi-final first leg in Madrid, he appeared to grasp it: his ability to slip so seamlessly into the rhythm of a game of that magnitude, and then maintain form five days later in the Premier League win at Liverpool, was a reminder of his qualities. He was a player who could be relied on, a defender of pedigree. There was very little rustiness to his game, and the beard was duly clipped. It all seemed to suggest that dream to become the first Englishman to feature at four World Cup finals would be realised.
And yet Hodgson is moving on. Baines will be first-choice in Brazil, and Shaw can learn from the experience and, as the manager witnessed yet again first-hand at St Mary's on Sunday, is ready to step up if required during the tournament. Cole would have travelled as a back-up, and where was the value in that? Better, surely, to blood Shaw in a travelling party and whet the youngster's appetite with France 2016 or Russia 2018 in mind.
The experienced man's reluctance to join the list of seven back-ups was surely anticipated. Liverpool's Jon Flanagan was selected in his stead, with the phone-call from Hodgson on Sunday evening bringing to a close an international career that has stretched for over 13 years since a debut against Albania in Tirana. David Seaman, Steve McManaman and Andy Cole played that night at the Qemal Stafa stadium, names from a bygone era. Only the debutant at left-back and Rio Ferdinand of those who started the visitors' 3-1 victory are still playing.
Cole's reputation at the top level soared in the seasons since. In terms of consistency, he has been one of the best left-backs in the world. He has performed brilliantly at times, most notably against Cristiano Ronaldo in brushes with Portugal that were ultimately surrendered on penalties. There have been low points, too, most of them born of club loyalties and the public caricature thrust on Cole â or generated himself by that infamous, ill-fated autobiography â and he was booed at Wembley after a skewed pass presented Kazakhstan with a goal in October 2008.
Yet history will surely remember him as the best England ever had at left-back and, should Chelsea not offer new terms, the calibre of club who will seek to secure his signature this summer â there is tentative interest from Paris Saint-Germain to Monaco to Real Madrid â will reflect his standing and enduring qualities.
The last of Cole's 107 caps was the only one he failed to start, the veteran replacing Shaw, the young pretender, at half-time against Denmark at Wembley in March. Those roles have now been reversed for good. This is the end of an era.
