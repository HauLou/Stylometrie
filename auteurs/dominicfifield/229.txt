José Mourinho has called for a strong performance from the referee Neil Swarbrick as he takes his Chelsea were beaten 3-2 in the Potteries last season, with Mourinho bemoaning their generosity with errors committed in the build-up to Stokeâs first and third goals.
While the home sideâs style has morphed slightly in recent times under the management of Mark Hughes, this fixture remains a tricky occasion â as Arsenal discovered earlier this month â with the Portuguese having already lectured Thibaut Courtois, who is expected to start, on the particular threat posed by Stoke at set-pieces.
âWith a good referee that can understand what is aggressivity, or when the aggression finishes and the rules of the game start, this will be no problem at all,â said Mourinho. âWe need a good referee, yes. A good, experienced referee who can understand exactly that. What happens in both boxes in this kind of match needs important decisions: what is aggressivity, and what goes beyond the rules of the game. That is important.
âI speak with Courtois and we prepare him, but the referee is there, and the referee has to know what is allowed and what is not allowed, according to the rules of the game. And the rules of the game are the same everywhere. So it should be no problem. I know itâs difficult for every team to play this kind of match [at Stoke], and we are no exception. But, again, Iâm not worried. The referee is there exactly to judge what is aggression, and welcome aggression â the pure one â makes the game much more beautiful. Heâs there to referee, not me.â
Swarbrick has taken charge of eight âRemember we are a physical side, too. So it should be no problem for us. We are physical too. Nemanja Matic is a football player. You can be a big guy and be a fantastic player. You can be a big and not be physical or overly aggressive. Matic plays. Look what he does on the pitch. A beautiful left foot. At this moment, the way Chelsea play we have no space for physical players without technical quality. We are a technical side who want to play football. We have our own identity. But we can compete with physicality. Thatâs no problem for us. The referee is there, and Iâm not worried because the referee is there.â
