Tim Sherwood hopes to meet the The stand-in manager oversaw his first victory in Sunday's 3-2 success at Southampton and will be in charge when West Bromwich Albion and Stoke City visit White Hart Lane over the Christmas period. The Spurs hierarchy are sounding out candidates for the position, with contact having been made with Louis van Gaal and Frank de Boer, though securing a full-time appointment mid-season and ahead of the World Cup finals is likely to prove problematic.
That has effectively improved the chances of Sherwood, whose previous work at the club had revolved around the academy and development squads, taking on the role at least until the end of the season. His approach to date has been that of a man expecting to assume duties on a longer-term basis, with an attack-minded tactical gameplan implemented at St Mary's and discipline already reestablished within the senior squad.
"People may think that (his reputation does not carry weight), but Tim will take no nonsense from anybody," said the full-back, Danny Rose. "At his first training session, a couple of lads rolled out on the training pitch late and he got us in a circle and said it was unacceptable, in polite words. He set out some new rules and you know not to mess with Tim, and that's good. Punctuality was one of them: when we go down to eat, for team meetings, but stuff on the training pitch as well. When he speaks, you've got to listen.
"Recently, we've not played the Tottenham way, attacking and counterattacking, and it's been hard with only one striker up front. Tim has said he doesn't know if he'll get the job, but that's how Tottenham should be playing â like we did in the second half on Sunday â and that's what we're trying to do, play attacking football. At times we know we may concede, but we want to be scoring quite a few goals every game."
Rose worked heavily with Sherwood in his previous capacity as technical co-ordinator and the full-back credits the 44-year-old, along with the previous manager Harry Redknapp, for improving his attitude. "Tim has been backing me and a lot of the other youngsters for a good three or four years," said the youngster. "He came to the club and, probably about four years ago, I sat down with him and Harry and they told me I needed to train a lot harder to have a chance in the team.
"I didn't get that many chances under Harry Redknapp. But from when I did change my attitude on the training pitch, I won Tim over and from then he has always been pushing me to try to get into the team â along with others like Jake Livermore, Nabil [Bentaleb] today and Andros Townsend as well."
The caretaker's first move was to reintegrate Emmanuel Adebayor in the squad to play in a front partnership, the Togo international having fallen out of favour under André Villas-Boas. The forward began the season training with Sherwood's under-21 squad, despite being one of the highest earners at the club, and was made to stand on a raised platform and apologise for his behaviour to the entire squad. He played only 45 minutes of first-team football under the Portuguese this season but has now scored three goals in the interim manager's two games in charge having been welcomed back into the fold.
"We had meetings about the situation but, if a manager thinks something about someone, then we've all got to respect," said Rose when asked about Adebayor's previous exclusion. "We might not agree with it, but we have to respect it. We are all just happy Ade's back now. When he plays like that, you can see why he's played for a lot of great clubs. He gives us another dimension: he can finish, hold the ball up, and he wins defensive headers from set pieces. He's definitely like a new signing.
"The fact he stood up and apologised shows he does want to play for the club. It goes without saying, he's not short of money so he could have just sat and not done anything. But he apologised and that's that. Whatever happened with the previous manager, it's up to the manager. But, as I said, we've just got to forget about that and look forward. The top four is still the aim. The previous manager wanted to win a trophy and finish in the top four, and it should be the same whoever comes in now or for Tim. Personally, I want to finish in the top four. The club flourished playing Champions League football and that's the aim."
