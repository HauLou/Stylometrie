The France international hurt the joint in an innocuous incident as he collected the ball just moments after heading the visitorsâ equaliser against Everton. Giroud has undergone two scans overseen by Arsenalâs medical staff, with the club pessimistic over what those examinations have revealed, though they will now seek the prognosis of a specialist tomorrow â on the day the first-team attempt to overcome Beskitas to force passage into the Champions League group stage â before confirming just how long the forward will be absent.
âHe will not play tomorrow,â said Wenger when asked about Giroudâs injury. âHe will see a specialist here in England tomorrow and, afterwards, we will make an announcement as to how long heâll be out. I donât know [how serious it is], but it can be [long-term]. Weâll see tomorrow. Itâs sad for us, but for the moment we are focused on tomorrowâs [Wednesdayâs] game.â
Asked whether Giroudâs absence would prompt him to secure another forward in what remains of the current window before Mondayâs cut-off, Wenger said: âI donât know. We are 24 hours from a big game and our focus is more on that than the transfer window. But Iâve learned one thing in our job: you say nothing âcategoricallyâ.â
He will also be without the suspended Aaron Ramsey against Besiktas, with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain likely to start the game alongside Mathieu Flamini. Arsenal have qualified for the group stage in each of the last 16 seasons, with progress worth around £20m in revenues. âFor us itâs very important to qualify,â added Wenger. âWe want to play at the top level, so itâs a very important game, more on the sporting side than the financial side. Nothing is unthinkable. It has happened to 99% of all the big clubs in Europe [not qualifying for the group stage] but we want to be in there and we think we have the potential to do it. The task is clear, and we know we can do it. So letâs do it.â
