The national team, probably more even than Wilshereâs club side given the number of attack-minded creators lured to the Emirates Stadium by Arsène Wenger, are desperate for the 23-year-old to thrive at this level. Successive managers have enjoyed flashes of his natural talent, Fabio Capello benefiting from his injury-free presence five times while Roy Hodgson has pondered how best to eke out the playerâs best. This was only his 28th cap as he approaches the fifth anniversary of his debut. If the frustration has been his fitness, this display offered confirmation of just how much he still offers. Admittedly He deserved his change of fortune because Wilshere alone had injected energy into Englandâs depressingly lacklustre display in Dublin a week previously, and he had maintained that busy approach here. He set the tone, snapping at opponents when possession had been surrendered, but more pertinently clipping neat, close passes to team-mates to set in motion the visitorsâ forays upfield. Those down Englandâs left side caught the eye for long periods in Ljubljana, with Fabian Delph, Kieran Gibbs and a revived Raheem Sterling scuttling forward in neat interchanges, but Wilshere was always free and ready to receive at their backs if the moves faltered. There were tackles, interceptions and much-needed accuracy in the passing: he offered reassurance even when What ensued after the interval was a reminder that while the midfielder has embraced the demands of the deeper role in which he has been employed for his country more recently, his best work is invariably still conjured in the attacking third of the pitch. Those two finishes proved as much. He ventured untracked into the pocket of space just outside the area to dispatch Adam Lallanaâs lay-offs, the first through Samir Handanovicâs desperate touch and the second, after a wonderfully slick move, so cleanly the goalkeeper stood no chance at all. âThey werenât just any old goals from Jack,â said Hodgson. âNeither of them was a tap-in. Both were fantastic and Jack took over the midfield in the second half. That was good to see.â
His last goal for his country had come at under-17 level, back when talk of his talent was starting to filter through. âItâs obviously nice to get my first [senior] goals for England, they have been a long time coming,â he offered at pitch-side in the aftermath, the travelling support still bouncing with glee behind the netting at the far end.
âI probably wouldnât have had a shot for the second one if I hadnât already scored, but after Iâd scored one I had more confidence. I have said that I need to score more goals, it is something I need to add to my game, something Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard and Paul Scholes have all done for England.â
Those are the talents by which Wilshere, quite rightly, should measure himself. He had managed only two goals through another interrupted domestic campaign, the second a strike just as stunning against West Bromwich Albion on the Premier Leagueâs final afternoon, and he must maintain that threat. The competition at club level next season will arguably be fiercer for him than it is with England, with whom he is starting to feel an automatic selection when fit and firing.
Where once he clung to that impressive performance against Brazil at Wembley in February 2013, now this should become his benchmark display. There is considerable improvement to be made across this lineup, not least perhaps finding a balance in midfield which could see a more naturally defensive-minded player shield the back line. But Wilshere feels integral. âIf we can keep him fit and he can get plenty of Premier League matches and international matches under his belt,â added Hodgson, âat his young age we think weâve got a good player going forward.â
The elder statesman ended up winning this game, Wayne Rooney drawing the focus four minutes from time with his 48th international goal, but Hodgson will edge into the closed season clutching plenty of younger positives.
Sterling, a year on from his eye-catching display against the But it still required Wilshereâs intervention to kick-start this display and inject proper belief into the teamâs approach. He departed Slovenia with no regrets at all.
