Phil Jones has insisted Englandâs challenge at the World Cup will not be undermined by ill-discipline despite Raheem Sterlingâs dismissal during Wednesdayâs penultimate friendly against Ecuador.
Sterling, a second-half substitute, was sent off 14 minutes after his introduction for a foul on Antonio Valencia, whose furious reaction led to the Manchester United man also being dismissed. Sterlingâs red card will deny the 19-year-old winger a last opportunity to impress Roy Hodgson before the tournament as he will be suspended for Saturdayâs friendly against Honduras and is likely to see his role at the finals initially restricted to cameos from the bench.
Yet Jones echoed his team-mates by describing the decision to send off the Liverpool player as overly severe. âThe referee was a bit harsh,â Jones said of Jair Marrufo. âI donât think Raheemâs done too much wrong. Itâs harsh. The referee probably couldâve kept them both on the pitch. Youâve got to deal with whatever gets thrown in your face and everyoneâs discipline is key but I donât think there was anything to worry about. Weâve talked about a lot of things over the last few weeks: thereâs no right and wrong, and people will pick up cards because itâs the nature of the game. But I donât think there was any maliciousness in this incident.
âIt was just harsh. Overall it was a fair game and evenly contested. Weâre happy to have another work-out under our belts and more acclimatisation to the heat. It was a good work-out and a good test against a good team. They tested us at times and I thought we coped with it well. We could have scored a few more goals but, overall, weâre pleased. It was difficult at times in the heat but thatâs what we wanted and thatâs what we expected. The preparation is for 14 June.â
Jones, who gained his 10th cap and played alongside his Manchester United club-mate Chris Smalling in central defence, has recovered fully from the shoulder injury sustained in Manchester Unitedâs victory against Hull City last month. Indeed, Roy Hodgson was moved to cite his display against Ecuador â along with those of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Wilshere â as particularly impressive. âThe shoulder feels good,â Jones added. âIt was a test to come through it and Iâve come through it fine. They had some big units out there. Theyâre no mugs, Ecuador. It was a good test and Iâm positive.â
