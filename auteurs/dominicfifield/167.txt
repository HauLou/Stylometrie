The visiting manager, whose side extended their unbeaten league run to 10 matches with an impressive victory to move to within three points of third place, also bemoaned a lack of acknowledgements in the official match day programme to mark the efforts put in by Lallana, Lovren and Rickie Lambert over their time on the south coast. All three were actually referenced in the club captain Kelvin Davisâs column on page 82 of the Saints magazine, though Rodgers felt the trio merited more.
âIt was always going to be difficult for the likes of Dejan and Adam,â said the Liverpool manager. âI was a bit disappointed for Adam. He was captain here for two years and gave incredible service to Southampton. I know he could have left a number of times and didnât, so to get the reception he did was disappointing. There was nothing in the match programme referencing his time here, either. I know Dejan was only here for a season, but there was no mention either for Lambert. Those two guys, Rickie and Adam, gave their heart and soul to Southampton and were big supporters of this club before moving on to one of the biggest clubs in the world at âThis is a fantastic club, a club who were in the While Lambert was granted a warm reception by the Southampton fans when he warmed up on the touchline, the locals vented their spleen regularly at Lallana and Lovren in recognition that both had agitated for moves to Merseyside, for around £24m and £20m respectively, last summer. Lallana appeared to have gone back on his word, having suggested he would see out his career on the south coast when signing his previous long-term contract. The midfielder was booed throughout while his father sat among the away supporters, his mother having opted against attending for fear of the reception her son might be given.
Southampton ended frustrated at the performance of the referee, Kevin Friend, who denied them at least two penalties, but âWe spoke and his explanation is between the player and the coach, but he was too late. I canât and I donât accept that. If he has to pay a fine, he pays the fine. But, in my opinion, the best way to keep the discipline in the team is not to pick him today.â
