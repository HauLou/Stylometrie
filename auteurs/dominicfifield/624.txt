But it has emerged that the independent commission which on Tuesday upheld the striker's red card also criticised the behaviour of Swansea's Chico Flores and called on the Football Association to crack down on simulation.
The commission had declined to rescind Carroll's ban â by two votes to one â because they deemed the referee Howard Webb not to have made an "obvious error" in showing a red card. But they were unimpressed with Flores's reaction after Carroll's right arm made contact with the top of the Spaniard's head.
In its judgment the commission emphasised "dissatisfaction with the conduct of Mr Flores, for simulating injury and unsporting conduct" and said "the commission look to the FA to find ways of dealing with this type of conduct".
The match delegate, Paul Allen, described Carroll's sending-off as "very harsh" in his report. But an interim tribunal, convened under Rule K8 of the FA's regulations and appointed by the arbitration specialists Sports Resolutions (UK), has deemed the original three-man independent commission was correct in upholding the red card. It listened to Carroll's case on Friday and reached that conclusion after five hours of deliberation.
West Ham had threatened legal action unless the FA agreed to refer the incident to arbitration. The club argued, under Rule K section of the FA's rulebook, that there had been "irrationality or procedural unfairness" in the three-man panel's reasoning and were seeking a "stay" on the ban before a final hearing â to be heard by a full tribunal â so that Carroll would be available to play in the interim.
The game's governing body agreed on Thursday to refer the matter to arbitration but, despite West Ham submitting extensive evidence that they hoped would see the original decision overturned, Nicholas Stewart QC, sitting alone as the interim tribunal,The club, who were ordered to pay the FA's £13,092 costs as well as those of the interim tribunal and hearing, confirmed they would not be taking the matter any further. "Whilst The player, who had set up both his side's goals to beat Swansea on only his second league start of the season, will miss Saturday's visit to Aston Villa and next week's critical home games against Norwich City and Southampton.
That will frustrate the West Ham manager, Sam Allardyce, who felt the original verdict had denied the club "justice". "In this case the [independent commission] were looking at it from the view of one thing only: was it an obvious mistake?" he said. "So we based our procedure on this and I'm 100% certain it was an obvious mistake: Howard Webb should have given a free-kick for Andy against Flores â [if] at that stage the whistle blows, there's no incident â"For me the conclusion could only have been that Webb felt that, even though he hadn't seen it 100%, he was reluctant not to give a red card on the basis that, if Andy had caught Flores full in the face or elbowed him or used violent conduct, which he didn't â it was at very best reckless â then he would've been in trouble with his group of referees and his bosses for not giving it."
Allardyce remains disgusted with Flores's overreaction, clutching his face on the turf despite contact having been made with the top of his head. "He has allowed people to say to players: 'You can get away with simulation to get someone sent off or get a decision in your favour,'" he said. "That is clear for all to see on what happened. Howard thought Andy had smashed him straight in the face by his reaction, and then when you see it after there is little or no contact and it is nowhere near his face, so it is a shame. The other scenario that he must feel a lot more guilty of is he has just got his manager sacked."
