âMonaco represents a lot for me,â offered the The monarch will presumably be pleased to see him, too. Evra, never overly keen on granting media interviews, was speaking on Canal Plus over the weekend with the narrow advantage in their Champions League quarter-final having been established last midweek back in Turin. They emerge at Stade Louis II on Wednesday evening with a 15-point advantage at the top of Serie A draining all intrigue from the domestic title race, and with an appearance in the Italian Cup final to come in June. Evra will hope to add more honours to the five Premier League titles, three League Cups and one European Cup plundered over a nine-year spell at Manchester United which ended last summer.
The only silverware he collected while making his name as a Monaco player from 2002-06 was a League Cup in his first campaign, but the one-time forward who had been converted â reluctantly, as it happens â into one of the modern eraâs most admired left-backs had been a mainstay of the side which eliminated Real Madrid and Chelsea en route to the Champions League final in 2004, a match lost to José Mourinhoâs Porto.
Evra forged his reputation on the Côte dâAzur, and returning with an imposing team intent on jettisoning a club he holds dear clearly pains him. âI donât like coming back to a former home like this because, when I play against a team, I like to be driven by this urge to âkillâ my opponent,â he said. âI wonât have that same motivation here. I canât. But I must concentrate on doing my job.â
There is nothing to suppose his form will suffer. Evra is enjoying a rather unexpected Indian summer to a glittering career, a veteran relishing a fresh chance on the other side of the Alps where the lingering traumas of Franceâs player mutiny at the 2010 World Cup are not held against him. Admittedly, the 33-year-old has had to win the locals over since his £1.2m departure from Old Trafford.
There was plenty of initial scepticism at his arrival. Many supposed he was spent as a force at this level, that lengthy career in a frantic Premier League having sapped the energy from those barrel-chested marauding charges down the flank. Juve, after all, had Kwadwo Asamoah â another converted to full-back â to provide that bustling running and balance from left wing-back. Evra was a luxury signing, a player to offer a bit more experience and cover to flesh out the squad ahead of a push for the Yet he has surpassed those rather low expectations. The older man has been understated, busying himself efficiently whether at training or in the team, adjusting his game to suit Serie A and excelling in the divisionâs outstanding side. He has confronted almost every issue football can throw up, so there could hardly be a surprise in store here, and ensuring he was quickly accepted as a senior and influential figure at a club already crammed with experience. Andrea Pirlo, Gianluigi Buffon, Giorgio Chiellini and his former United team-mate, Carlos Tevez, have accepted him into the core of the squad, convinced as they are he still has plenty to offer on the pitch.
His compatriot, Paul Pogba, has taken to calling him He has featured in 19 league games to date and six European matches, his confidence aided by a goal to beat Sampdoria in December. Asamoah suffered a serious knee injury that month which has cast the Ghanaian to the sidelines. Evra has since benefited from Massimiliano Allegriâs willingness to play four at the back, a set-up with which the Frenchman is clearly most comfortable.
âHe had a couple of months of adaptation, but Patrice has proved his value to the team since,â said the manager. âHeâs a very intelligent player who has played in England for a long time, playing a very different style of football there. But heâs having an impressive season with us. Heâs a strong personality, an important player, and showing why heâs been playing at the top level for so long. His career speaks for itself.â
Italy suits him. The fact he can interact with his new team-mates has helped. He had learned the language earlier in his career, in spells at Marsala in Serie C1 and Monza in Serie B in the late 1990s, and that has clearly helped him settle, but the whole pace of the game â of life â has proved agreeable, even if adapting to new training techniques has proved somewhat more trying. âJuve, thatâs a big and difficult challenge, but it was one which suited my mentality,â he had added to Canal Plus. âDidier [Deschamps] was in love with Juve. He told me: âMate, you will see, Juve is huge.â In truth, you get the impression that youâre like a bottle of wine here. The older you get, the better the taste.â
