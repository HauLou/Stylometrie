Tony Pulis' team secured a sixth league win in 12 games under his stewardship against Hull City on Tuesday, a result which hoisted them further from the relegation zone, yet he has achieved that upturn with the same personnel who were languishing at the foot of the table with four points from their first 11 games when he was appointed in November. Only Palace and Arsenal have not added to their options this month, with Pulis having indicated this week he is still "hoping and praying" targets could be secured before the 11pm deadline.
Palace are one of the swath of top-flight clubs to whom Thomas Ince has spoken this week but they could not take the Blackpool player on loan without making permanent either Jason Puncheon's or Cameron Jerome's own loan deal at the club. Interest has been expressed in Walters, though the fee of £5m, and potentially hefty accompanying wage package, is likely to prove prohibitive for a forward who excelled under Pulis at the Britannia Stadium.
A more likely arrival is Buckley, of Brighton and Hove Albion, who is available at around £1.5m, while Palace are competing with Norwich City for Rovers' Dann. No fee has, as yet, been agreed by either club for the former Birmingham City defender.
Ramis had been on the verge of joining Cardiff City last weekend only for the Welsh club to pull the plug on the deal after the Spaniard's medical revealed the severity of a cruciate knee ligament injury suffered earlier in his career, though Pulis believes the centre-back can still perform at this level.
Palace, who have released Elliot Grandin after only one appearance since his arrival last summer, remain hopeful they can persuade Momo Sissoko to sign under freedom of contract despite the former Liverpool and Juventus midfielder having travelled to Spain to spend time with Rayo Vallecano. The Mali international has not had a club since he left Paris St-Germain last summer.
