Ashley Cole broke down in tears as he, Talks have been continuing with the representatives of the England men, who have 1,609 appearances for Cole started the goalless draw against "But now it's time to wait a little. The summer is a long summer for us. For you, the media, with the World Cup, it's a different story. For the players involved in the World Cup it's a different story. But for us, as a club, it's a long time to be calm and to sit and to discuss and to analyse options and the market and possibilities. It's a long summer for us."
Mourinho described his side's first-half showing as "lazy, slow, no pressure, never pressing an opponent" as they endured a third successive home game without a win, a display he suggested was largely due to a sense of deflation following their midweek elimination from the Champions League to Atlético Madrid.
"When you lose a semi-final and you know that you are not realistically in the title race, too, the mental energy disappears, the focus disappears, and you start thinking more about 'what next' than what you have to do now," he said. "That was reflected in the first half. We did enough to win after that, but we didn't."
Asked whether that was born of familiar shortcomings in front of goal â his team managed 23 shots but only four on target â Mourinho concurred. "Of course, yes. Our strikers are good strikers but our players lack some specific qualities. They are not the kind who, with five square metres and three or four people around, can dribble and find the space to shoot. But they are good players. They did everything they could in the season to help. In a competition full of good teams and a Champions League against the best teams in the world, which is not the case in the Europa League, the boys did a good job. A job that doesn't make us completely happy. We want more. But it's a base.
"They tried everything, with a couple of 'festivals' we had during the season â¦ [a reference to his dissatisfaction with the performances of the officials in the recent defeats to Aston Villa and Sunderland] Without those 'festivals' it would have been a better season too. But we could have been better in some matches. We could have done better against Crystal Palace, or killing matches at Everton, Newcastle, Stoke. Matches we lost where we had the games under control but didn't kill them and we were killed. But it's a very dangerous league. We were always there, never outside the top four or outside the title race from day one while important teams did not reach their minimum objectives. A very dangerous league."
It is likely to have proved too perilous for Norwich, whose fate could effectively be sealed if Sunderland draw at home to West Bromwich Albion on Wednesday night, a result that would leave City requiring an outlandish swing in goal difference on the final afternoon when they host Arsenal. This was a first point in nine away games, and the first reward of Neil Adams' tenure as interim manager. "I'm immensely proud," he said. "I thought it was a phenomenal performance. We had a gameplan and the players executed it virtually to perfection. I'd have liked a bit more of an attacking threat, but we had a stonewall penalty denied us in the first half. Had we got that we might have been leaving Stamford Bridge with a result. I've had a look and it's pretty clear: definitely a penalty.
