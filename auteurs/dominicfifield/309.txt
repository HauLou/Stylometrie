The This was already a niggly, fractious contest out on the pitch before the two men who should set the tone were engaging in handbags on the touchline. A foul from Gary Cahill on Alexis Sánchez enraged Arsène Wenger, who marched out of his technical area towards the incident and was duly blocked by José Mourinho, waving the The atmosphere had partly been charged, of course, by Cesc Fàbregasâs presence in Chelsea colours against the club for whom he played 306 games earlier in his career. He had been billed as the villain prior to kick-off, with boos from those filing into the away end â once the flares had cleared or been seized prior to kick-off â greeting the announcement of his name. Yet the Spaniard was largely becalmed, his probing passes delivered from deep with Mathieu Flamini usually snapping at his heels. Then, just as the contest felt back on edge, he conjured a trademark glorious pass to cut out Arsenalâs back line and Diego Costa converted. He celebrated with the striker but this must all have been a strange experience for the 27-year-old. A seventh Premier League assist of the season made this reunion rewarding.
Mildly criticised by the management after last weekendâs victory over Aston Villa, when his performance dipped in terms of productivity, the Belgian was at his elusive best here. His swerving run away from Santi Cazorla and Calum Chambers into the area, to draw the foul from Laurent Koscielny for his teamâs first-half penalty, took the breath away. There were darts down the flank, slaloms inside and effervescence throughout. It is perhaps unfair to compare but Mesut Özil cost almost £10m more than Hazard. Both crave a No10 berth but are currently operating from wide, yet their respective displays were poles apart.
Washed away 6-0 in this fixture last season, Arsenal did at least resist more effectively this time. Jack Wilshere and Flamini were tight on opponents throughout and Sánchez and even Cazorla worked feverishly. Their defensive nous might have been tested more sternly had Koscielny been dismissed for conceding the penalty or, indeed, Chambers followed after blocking Hazard when already on a booking. (Danny Welbeck might also have seen red for a two-footed lunge at Fabregas in the final minute.) But there was plenty to admire in their solidity until they over-committed in search of an equaliser. The problem was it all went unrewarded. Wenger has now gone 12 games against Mourinho without enjoying a victory. His team have lost their unbeaten league record and are now nine points off the top.
