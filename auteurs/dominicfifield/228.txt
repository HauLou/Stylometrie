José Mourinhoâs insistence that the good of the collective be placed ahead of an individualâs desire to feature dictates that the The Portuguese takes his side to âItâs not a difficult situation for me,â said Mourinho when asked how the likes of Luís or, indeed, the World Cup winner André Schürrle react to being omitted from his starting team. âIâm very club, team, team, club, group. I think everybody has to be ready to sacrifice for the team, to give everything for the team, to think about the team, not to be selfish. This is the way I want a team to be.
âLook at Mikel. The first time he played was Newcastle and he was our best player. How can he be our best player if he didnât play in three months? Because he was working every day at the top level. Sad, frustrated, not happy? Maybe. But professional. Thatâs what I expect from the players.
âIf they are not involved I donât have a secret to keeping them happy. They are unhappy and frustrated, and need to be patient, but the reality is that, to be successful and work at a high level, you donât need to be happy. All of them are professionals. The team is more important than individuals. Mark Schwarzer hasnât played a second, but if he has to play tomorrow he would because heâs ready. Heâs trained very well. We may have a secret to make them work every day at a high level, but no secret to keep them happy.â
Mourinho will confirm his team for the Stoke fixture in a pre-match meeting, but there will be no explanation offered to those being omitted unless they specifically seek one out. âI just put the team up,â said the manager. âNo explanation, because itâs my decision. The players may not be happy, or not agree with the decision, but they know my decision is not to favour somebody or to punish somebody. Itâs what I think is best for the team at a certain moment. This is the way I do it.
âItâs one of the first things I say to a squad at the beginning of the season: I told them I donât give explanations. I said they could knock on my office door. If they come to me and ask me to explain, no problem. But, in principle, I wonât do it on my initiative. I have to make life easy for me. If I explain to one, I have to give them all explanations [why they are not playing]. In Christmas Iâd spend all my time explaining things.
âIf they ask, Iâll explain. I had one who asked, knocking on my door asking why someone else was playing instead of him. I told him the other man was playing better, closed the door, goodbye. Itâs the concept of helping the team. Anyone who joins us must know the squad is strong at Chelsea. If you are a goalkeeper here, you canât come in thinking you are the only good goalkeeper. The same for the strikers.â
Mourinho claimed no members of the current Chelsea squad have made their frustrations known to the management at a lack of first-team opportunities. Indeed, he even suggested Iker Casillas had not made his frustrations known face to face after his high-profile fall-out with the manager at his previous club, Real Madrid, where the manager adopted a similar policy.
âBut even when I sign a player I have to believe he will join in with the way we work, the way we live,â he added. âHe has to adapt to this certain kind of mentality.â
