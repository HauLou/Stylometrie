When South Koreaâs Kim Seung-gyu parried Divock Origiâs shot at the Arena Corinthians on Thursday and Jan Vertonghen reacted sharpest to convert the rebound, becoming Belgiumâs first goalscoring captain in this competition since the current coach Marc Wilmots registered against Russia 12 years ago, the net had bulged for the 136th time in 48 matches in Brazil. The previous record for a 32-team tournament had stood at 130 back in 2002, and there had been only 101 goals in the group stage back in South Africa. Indeed, that month spent from Highveld to the Cape coast yielded only 145 goals in total.
This summerâs extravagance has been more than a mere quirk. If anything, it follows on from the trend set at last yearâs Confederations Cup when 18 matches produced 68 goals, albeit figures distorted by the 24 conceded in three by Tahiti. âItâs not been surprising, no, and Iâd envisaged an offensive tournament before we started,â says Gérard Houllier, the former Liverpool manager who is working as head of Fifaâs technical study group out in Brazil. âThe fashion at the moment is that teams go for it. Usually, when you score first in a game, history tells you that on 80% of occasions you will either win or draw. But not here. Remember the upsets, the number of teams who were 1-0 down but ended up winning: Holland against Spain in their first group game, Costa Rica against Uruguay. Those that want to win more than they donât want to lose, they are more rewarded.â
That England and Spain mustered the fewest shots of all teams involved, just 24 each, and were eliminated backs up that view. Combined, they actually conceded fewer attempts than the United States (56) who can now look forward to a last 16 game against the Belgians.
âBut why is it coming off?â asks Houllier. âOne reason is the number of measures that have been taken by Fifa over the years to favour the strikers: the last defender rule [players being aware they can be sent off for denying a goalscoring opportunity], the tackle from behind, the pass back to the goalkeeper, the passive and active offside rule. All these measures have probably allowed a more open flow to the front play.
âThe second reason is simply that there is a generation of very good strikers out there at the moment. All the top teams have good forwards. Sometimes they have world-class strikers.
âNeymar plays an important role with Brazil, involved with something like 60% of their goals. When Argentina won their first two games, 2-1 and 1-0, Lionel Messi was absolutely instrumental and he scored twice in their third. Germany, with Thomas Müller. The French with Karim Benzema, who is absolutely on fire. Thereâs a generation of very good strikers who are making their presence felt â it is a shame Sweden, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, are not here too â and they make a difference. In the last minute of Portugal against the United States, it was Cristiano Ronaldo who made the cross for the equaliser. So the measures to influence positive, attacking football, plus the strikers and the attitude of the teams.â
To date, arguably only Ronaldo â hampered as he was by a knee injury â of the stellar forward contingent has failed to illuminate consistently in front of goal, his lack of fortune against Ghana on Thursday indicative of his tournament.
Messi, Neymar and Müller have each scored four already. Benzema has three, a missed penalty and a sublime finish at the death against the Swiss that was ruled out by the refereeâs final whistle. Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie have been effervescent, propelling the Dutch challenge from a daunting group. The flip side, of course, is arguably a dearth of high calibre defenders to repel these attacking talents. It says much that Franceâs fourth choice centre-back, Eliaquim Mangala, who has yet to feature in Brazil and boasts only three caps, is apparently on the market for in excess of £30m at Porto. Central defenders are at a premium.
This tournament has been less about enjoying blanket possession and more about instigating effective penetration. As well, of course, as coping with the conditions. There are eight teams from the Americas and two African nations in the last 16 â both records â with six Europeans still involved in what has been dubbed locally as the âThink of the smaller nations. [Antonio] Valencia is at Manchester United and, when he goes home to Ecuador, he tells them how things are done there. Coaches now, either through the internet or on courses or even through their players, get more information and are more educated in a âEuropean wayâ. And they are better players. Everybody works. Everyone. If you look at the âsurprisesâ, who would have thought that Costa Rica would top Group D with seven points? No one would have bet a single penny on that. Chile we knew. They outplayed England at Wembley last year. But look at their defence: one player released by Nottingham Forest [Gonzalo Jara]; another who went down with Cardiff [Gary Medel]; a third who went down with Osasuna [Francisco Silva].
âItâs interesting because when Spain have suffered in big tournaments recently â apart from Brazil in the Confederations Cup last year when they were tired â it was to teams playing three at the back. Italy in the first game at Euro 2012, 1-1, when Italy played 3-5-2. Holland, who always play four at the back, played three with two wing-backs against them here, probably to get bodies in the middle. And also Chile. They played three at the back, 3-4-1-2, a very audacious style. The coaches tend to play with no regrets. They go for it.â So far, that bravery has paid off handsomely.
