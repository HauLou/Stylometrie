The former Real Madrid defender Aitor Karanka is in pole position to succeed Ian Holloway as manager of Karanka, who worked as José Mourinho's No2 at the Bernabéu throughout his three-year spell in Spain, spoke with the Palace co-chairman Steve Parish last week to discuss the prospect of succeeding Ian Holloway at Selhurst Park. He was one of a number of candidates who underwent informal interviewswith the club's hierarchy but, having impressed Parish with his ambition and philosophy, the Spaniard is expected in London next week for further talks.
The 40-year-old, who left Real last summer when the incoming Carlo Ancelotti brought in his own coaching staff, could potentially be in place for the trip to Hull City on 23 November as Palace seek to arrest an alarming start to their Premier League campaign. Last weekend's loss at West Bromwich Albion was a seventh in succession, with high-flying Everton due in south London on Saturday and the caretaker manager, Keith Millen, still in temporary charge of the team.
Karanka's appointment to a first managerial position would represent something of a risk given his lack of experience as a No1 in the dugout, let alone the fact he has never previously worked in England. As a player the centre-half enjoyed a glittering career with Athletic Bilbao and, in particular, Real where he was part of a squad which claimed three European Cups, a La Liga title, the Spanish Super Cup and the Intercontinental Cup.
While he only accrued one cap for Spain â he did play six times for the Basque Country between 1994 and 2004 â Karanka played briefly in Major League Soccer with Colorado Rapids and did go on to coach the Spanish national association's under-16s for two years prior to joining up with Mourinho in Madrid. "I know him very, very well," said the Chelsea manager of his former assistant. "I think the club that gets him, whether in England or another country, will be a lucky club."
There was support for the appointment of the Wales manager, Chris Coleman, among some board members at Palace though the former Palace, Blackburn and Fulham defender will extend his spell with the national set-up after holding talks over a contract extension on Friday. Coleman's current deal expires after the forthcoming international window.
Palace had also spoken to Tony Pulis and Martin O'Neill, who has since taken up a position with the Republic of Ireland. Both experienced candidates were earning considerable salaries in their previous roles and were sceptical about taking on the challenge of keeping Palace, with three points from 10 games to date, in the top flight.
