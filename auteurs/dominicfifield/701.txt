Crystal Palace's game with Cardiff City on Saturday. It did not manifest itself in a clichéd punt up field towards a beanpole striker, or even a throw-in propelled like a javelin into a clutter of bodies in the penalty area. Instead it was exposed by Marouane Chamakh winning a simple free-kick.
Cardiff were mustering for another foray into the Palace half when the much maligned striker snapped at his marker, regained possession and, as he protected the ball, was crunched and left in a heap. Palace won a free-kick and could encroach into Cardiff territory, a nervy start having already been overcome. Within a few minutes they would be ahead as further hassling and harrying prompted panic in the visiting ranks. By the end of the match a side who had appeared out of their depth a month ago were level on points with the team the other side of the relegation cut-off.
New management seems to provoke flurries of form. Sunderland were devoid of conviction and winless when Gus Poyet replaced Paolo Di Canio, and promptly won his first three home matches in all competitions. Rene Meulensteen upgraded from head coach to manager at Fulham and oversaw an improved display in defeat to Tottenham Hotspur and a comfortable, yet impressive, victory over Aston Villa on Sunday.
Pulis inherited a team who had been under Keith Millen's caretaker stewardship for a month following the departure of Ian Holloway and was in the stands at Hull when they secured their first away win of the season. Palace's run stands at 10 points from five games. They are fifth in the Premier League's form guide over the last six fixtures and travel to Chelsea on Saturday anything but daunted.
The concern expressed by some at Pulis's appointment had been born of memories of Stoke's muscular aggression and direct approach that had ruffled feathers so effectively among the elite, even if such snootiness rather suggested Palace had scintillated consistently in the Championship over recent seasons. Those who witnessed the pragmatic style implemented under Dougie Freedman in reinventing this team, transforming them into a side with backbone, might offer perspective. Palace had hardly been a blur of incisive attacking intent under Holloway this season either and had scored only seven league goals in 12 games as Pulis prepared to take charge of his first match proper, a defeat at Norwich. What they had required was toughening up and re-energising.
That is what the new man has implemented. There has been no discernible change in the team's style, whether that be direct or patient in the buildup, but Palace have gone back to basics. They have reverted to the solidity of a 4-4-2, providing a platform for a defence that has shipped only once in five matches and, at the other end, ensuring Chamakh and Cameron Jerome are less isolated than the lone forward had been in a 4-2-3-1 formation. The side are pressing forward, seeking to stifle opponents at source. They are not at Southampton levels as yet â far from it â but they can still unsettle. Cardiff were harassed out of possession just as West Ham had been. Urgency still goes a long way and can shake players whose form has slumped from their doldrums.
The captain, Mile Jedinak, has spoken of the change being "fresh and positive" at the training ground. As yet there has been no revolution in terms of daily sessions. Palace's players are not reporting to the local swimming pool as they once did for Iain Dowie but they are increasingly meeting up late morning to settle into their working day by brunching together, with Pulis often taking training in the afternoon. That might appear insignificant but there had been splits in this camp, with cliques between new players and old. Any time to bond as a group is welcome.
The manager has spoken of the basic principles by which he has always operated: discipline, organisation, respect. This team probably needed reminding of all three â an old school approach was precisely what Palace required. "The gaffer has come in, nailed down a few things he wanted and the boys have responded really well," Jedinak said. "It is new and we are still learning from him. As long as we keep showing that same attitude towards each other and the gaffer it is very encouraging." There had been nothing up-and-under about the Australian's slick link-up with the full-back Joel Ward which saw the hosts cut through Cardiff ranks at breathtaking pace.
The improvements have been evident. If Palace had been exasperatingly blunt at Norwich in his first game in charge and rode their luck at times against West Ham, they were impressive against Cardiff. Chamakh's confidence grows with every outing, a player relishing support from the flanks and faith from the dug-out. Barry Bannan is looking more like the youngster who had briefly threatened to illuminate Aston Villa's first team. Jerome, after 21 scoreless matches, has his own point to prove both to Pulis, who had under-used him at Stoke, and to the Palace board who might otherwise have been tempted to free up a loan place in January.
The manager will still try to sign five players in next month's window to raise the quality at his disposal and, by keeping his side in contention, he can aspire to attract players to Selhurst Park. These are early days but that familiar spurt of form after an appointment has offered hope. The co-chairman, Steve Parish, had stated he had recruited a "track record" to the club in turning to Pulis. The prospect that Pulis might emulate his achievements in keeping up Stoke does not seem quite so outlandish.
