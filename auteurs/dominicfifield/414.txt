Luis Suárez has apologised to Giorgio Chiellini âand the entire football familyâ for biting the In a move instigated without Liverpoolâs knowledge and that will inevitably be considered as a public relations ploy from the strikerâs camp before a mooted transfer to Barcelona, Suárez tweeted his apology on Monday from his home outside Montevideo. The forward, twice previously sanctioned for biting an opponent on the field of play, vowed there would ânever again be another incident like thisâ and expressed his regret at what had occurred in Uruguayâs critical 1-0 Group D victory in Natal.
âAfter several days of being home with my family, I have had the opportunity to regain my calm and reflect about the reality of what occurred during the Italy-Uruguay match on 24 June 2014,â he wrote. âIndependent from the fallout and the contradicting declarations that have surfaced during these past days, all of which have been without the intention of interfering with the good performance of my national team, the truth is that my colleague Giorgio Chiellini suffered the physical result of a bite in the collision he suffered with me. For this I deeply regret what occurred. I apologise to Giorgio Chiellini and the entire football family. I vow to the public that there will never again be another incident like this.â

The Juventus defender, who had previously expressed surprise at the length of the ban imposed on the striker, tweeted back to his opponent: âItâs forgotten. I hope Fifa will reduce your suspension.â
Suárezâs statement was dated 30 June and was published just five days after he had submitted in his defence a very different version of the clash with Chiellini to Fifa, having consulted with his lawyer Alejandro Balbi, as the matter was considered by the bodyâs seven-strong disciplinary committee. âIn no way it happened how you have described, as a bite or intent to bite,â the forward had written in Spanish. âAfter the impact I lost my balance, making my body unstable and falling on top of my opponent.
âAt that moment I hit my face against the player, leaving a small bruise on my cheek and a strong pain in my teeth.â Fifa duly ruled the bite was âdeliberate, intentional and without provocationâ and banned the player for nine competitive The severity of the ban was partly due to this being his third such offence, following on from other incidents with Ajax and Perhaps more pertinently, there had been strong suggestions in Spain that Liverpool, who are considering their own response to Fifaâs punishment of their player, do not feel under any particular pressure to sell a striker who scored 31 Premier League goals last season and it would require a deal that triggers the release clause in the playerâs contract, believed to be set at close to £80m, for them to respond. However, they are increasingly braced for the player seeking a move away from Anfield, with the Camp Nou understood to be his preferred destination.
