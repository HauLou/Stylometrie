Per Mertesacker has admitted the emphatic nature of Germanyâs semi-final victory over Brazil could prove âdangerousâ as the team seek to ward off complacency and secure a fourth The 7-1 dismissal of the hosts in Belo Horizonte, the That victory 24 years ago in Romeâs Stadio Olimpico came at the expense of Diego Maradonaâs Argentina, with the 53-year-old quoted this week suggesting Tuesdayâs semi-final thrashing had gone to Germanyâs heads. âThey are, as we say, full of themselves,â he said. âThat is better for While that assessment has been rejected by senior members of Löwâs squad, there is a realisation that Alejandro Sabellaâs team will pose a very different threat to that presented by Brazil, with the chances of a repeat walkover â even to match their 4-0 quarter-final defeat of this opposition in South Africa four years ago â considered unlikely.
âOf course it is dangerous,â said Mertesacker when asked if the ease of the teamâs victory against Brazil might lull them into a false sense of security.
âWe want to finish on a high, and that means performance-wise. Our performance against Brazil was nearly 100%. If you look at the stats, the passing, the goals we scored â¦ everything was so fluent. Everyone coped with the pressure situation well.
âYou could see the difference between the teams and thatâs why we created history. But thatâs not all. We want more. We want more history. We donât want to just settle for this result before the final.
âAfter that game, itâs going to be hard not to be considered favourites for the final, but we must stay focused. We canât lose our focus now because we scored seven goals. We must keep calm and be aware of the situation. Thereâs one game missing and we must stay focused and play the same way that we did against Brazil. We want to achieve something special with this team. We played a good match with Brazil but we have to show another game with the same attitude, with the same focus,â added the Arsenal defender, who started on the bench against Brazil on Tuesday before replacing Mats Hummels for the second half with âThatâs needed in the final, otherwise we have no chance. If we drop even five per cent then we have no chance. Everyone had to calm down after midweek. Itâs hard after such a result, but everyone needed to calm down and regroup after the semi-final and try to finish well, and thatâs our main target for the final.â
