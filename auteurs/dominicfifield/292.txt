Adel Taarabt trained with Harry Redknappâs first-team squad at Queens Park Rangers on Wednesday as club, manager and player attempted the first tentative steps towards a measure of reconciliation after their very public recent fall-out.
The QPR chairman, Tony Fernandes, had issued a statement on Tuesday admonishing the pair for the spat which had erupted over the midfielderâs weight and ordered both parties to cease their war of words. The club declined to go into detail over what internal action, if any, had been taken against Taarabt or, indeed, Redknapp with the potential there for both to be fined in the wake of their dispute earlier this week.
Taarabt had appeared to bring the club into disrepute with his unauthorised response to Redknappâs claims that he is three stone overweight, comments made after Sundayâs 3-2 defeat to Liverpool at Loftus Road. The Moroccan could have been fined up to two weeksâ wages for his own comments â he earns £65,000 a week, with the Professional Footballersâ Association monitoring the situation closely â though there was also the possibility that Redknapp could be disciplined with Fernandesâs patience sorely tested by his outbursts first in his post-match press conference and then in print on Tuesday afternoon.
The London clubâs squad had been granted two days off after the match against Liverpool, meaning Wednesday was the first day manager and player would come face to face since the spat. Taarabt was in attendance at QPRâs Harlington base and is understood to have trained with the first team. While the priority is uniting the squad before next Mondayâs game against Aston Villa â Fernandesâs statement read: âAs a club, we are fully aware of stories in the press over the last few days regarding Harry Redknapp and Adel Taarabt. We regret these issues being played out in public and both âOn behalf of the club, I would like to apologise to the QPR supporters for the embarrassment this has caused and confirm that the issue has been dealt with internally. The clubâs entire focus is now on the Aston Villa fixture next Monday and hopefully after a tough few days we can turn a negative into a positive and build on Sundayâs improved display.â
Redknapp had accused Taarabt, who has made only two substitute appearances in the Premier League to date this term, of being overweight, prompting the 25-year-old â who spent time on loan at Milan last season â to respond: â[Redknapp] spends most of the time in his office but when he gets off the phone he comes down to watch for five or 10 minutes â he never takes a session. The training sessions arenât what I would expect under another manager. They are not as intense, the players arenât as motivated.â
The manager subsequently told the Sun: âThe only reason he has lost weight is because he has had tonsillitis. Thatâs the only way we could get any weight off him. He is not fit to play a game, thatâs the truth. He is the worst professional I have ever come across and I have been his only ally at QPR for the past three years. He doesnât try and I have protected him for too long.
âThe fitness coaches at QPR, everybody tells me he doesnât try. He doesnât want to run around. I have tried to protect him until now, but the fans have to know whatâs going on. Even I could suck my stomach in for a picture and look OK.â
After Taarabtâs loan spell at Milan, the Italian side deemed QPRâs £6m asking price for a permanent deal too steep to pursue. However, the
