René Meulensteen believes he retains the backing of the Fulham prop up the Premier League after Saturday's demoralising home defeat to Southampton, their fourth league loss in succession, and play Sheffield United of League One in an FA Cup fourth round replay on Tuesday.
Meulensteen, who boasted no experience as a senior manager on his appointment in December, has lost eight of 11 league games after taking up the reins when Fulham had 10 points from 13 matches.
The owner sanctioned the arrivals of seven players in January, which served as public backing for his rookie manager. "It was a huge statement of intent to back us with the transfer money," Meulensteen said. "I had the privilege to meet Mr Khan in America over the summer and, straight away, I felt he was a really thorough, amicable man who's very successful in business. He doesn't do anything knee-jerk. He thinks about things and there's a rationale to everything. His whole business is built on getting the right people in and trusting them to do the right things. He understands the situation all right. I have full respect and admiration for the support he's given me and the club in the last transfer window. He's been absolutely top drawer.
"I stay in regular contact with him and all I can do is live up to his expectations and that's what I intend to do. I have his support 100% but more importantly I have the full confidence of the squad."
Curbishley, who has experienced successful scraps against relegation as a manager with Charlton and West Ham, was confirmed as technical director over Christmas on Meulensteen's recommendation, in much the same way that the Dutchman's arrival as head coach had been promoted by the former manager, Martin Jol.
Fulham are arguably playing more purposeful football than earlier in the campaign but chances are being missed and their defence is more porous â they have shipped 29 goals in 11 gamesâ than it had been over the first four months of the season.
In that context, Curbishley's presence could be considered unnerving. "Not at all," Meulensteen said. "I brought Alan into this club as part of my squad, to give me the best possible backbone. He's as much responsible as myself, Ray Wilkins, John Hill and Mike Priest. Were all in this together. I wanted Alan here for these scenarios: he has gone through that roller-coaster of emotion before. He is utterly 100% supportive of me, Ray and all the others. We keep making sure we move forward in the right way and get the right plan together for the next couple of months."
Only Clint Dempsey of the recent arrivals is eligible to play against The club shed its "luxury" players over January with Dimitar Berbatov, Bryan Ruiz and Adel Taarabt departing. "The only way to get out of this mess is to have a stack of totally committed players who want to work and do the necessary job," Meulensteen said. "Because of where we are, the job has to change slightly. We have to be more disciplined defensively, more organised, instead of just flying forward. Look at the quality and the experience that we have in the squad, the determination. The ingredients are there for us to stay up. It's up to us to make sure that happens."
