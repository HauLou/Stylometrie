José Mourinho is facing a fine of around £10,000 from the Football Association after the governing body charged him with improper conduct for re-entering the field of play in stoppage time during Chelsea's defeat at The Portuguese, together with members of the home bench, had reacted to Ramires' ugly challenge on the Villa midfielder Karim El Ahmadi, a tackle that led to the Brazilian being dismissed and that prompted a mini pitch invasion from both dugouts. The match official, Chris Foy, ordered the managers, coaching staff and substitutes from the turf but Mourinho, who had become infuriated by the referee's performance, immediately came back on to the pitch, signalling for a "timeout", and was promptly sent to the stands by the official.
It was the second time the "José Mourinho has been charged by the FA following his side's game against Aston Villa on Saturday," read a statement from the governing body, who had spent this week reviewing footage of the incident before determining whether there was a charge to bring.
