âsqueaky bum timeâ rendering the most experienced figures diminished in their dugouts as they sense the chasing pack closing in at pace and their lead being whittled away. So, with that in mind, José Mourinhoâs mood on the eve of the visit of resurgent Manchester United to south-west London provided a fair barometer of the anxiety gripping at Chelsea.
There was sympathy with the complaints voiced by Steve Clarke and Arsène Wenger over the clash between Saturdayâs FA Cup semi-final and the most enticing Premier League game of the weekend, and bemusement at the maelstrom embroiling the champions, Manchester City. He even joked about match delegates spending too much time eating their âsushi and lobsterâ and supping âfine Champagne, Cristalâ in the lounges at Stamford Bridge. âThey donât see the games but just stay eating and drinking,â he offered through a broad grin when attempting to explain how his side had been ranked worst in the division when it came to respect for the officials. âWe should feed them bread and water.â
All was calm, utterly at ease, almost jolly. Contrast that with the atmosphere a year ago when Mourinho, his mood darkened by a succession of Football Association disciplinary charges and a cramped fixture schedule with a Champions League semi-final still to come, had dispatched his assistant Steve Holland to conduct the media briefing before the visit of bottom-placed Sunderland. Chelsea would have been top with three to play had they won that game. Instead they surrendered the managerâs 77-game unbeaten home record in the division and were effectively jettisoned from the title race, with Mourinho and his staff left livid by the officials. There would be further sanctions for their snarled reaction later in the month.
A year on and all is very much more relaxed. The leaders have lost their top scorer, Diego Costa, to another hamstring injury and his back-up Loïc Rémy to a calf strain â with Dominic Solanke, 17, on the bench instead â but Chelsea are seven points clear of Arsenal and eight of United with a game in hand on each. The message being transmitted from Cobham was that, for all they care, the pressure can fester elsewhere.
The closest rivals in the pursuit await in the leadersâ next two matches, Saturdayâs visit of a United side who have won their past six league games being followed by a trip to an Arsenal team who are on a run of eight straight victories, but the onus is on those playing catch-up to make this race properly interesting.
âI know the ideal scenario for people in this country would be for the Other sides would have been held by a stubborn Queens Park Rangers team last Sunday but Chelsea pilfered a winner late on with their only shot on target. If only privately, the sight of Cesc Fàbregas scoring and John Terry leading the post-match celebrations on the pitch at Loftus Road must have knocked the stuffing out of those teams who count themselves as challengers.
United are principal among them. Their dismantling of City in the derby confirmed that Louis van Gaal, once Mourinhoâs mentor, is overseeing a team who will be capable of restoring the club to the pinnacle. Go unblemished from now until the end of the season, winning at Stamford Bridge and overcoming Arsenal at Old Trafford on 17 May, and could they still have a chance? âItâs still possible,â said the Dutchman. âItâs not logical but it is possible. Itâs more when and if â and I donât believe in when and if. I believe in facts. The fact is that we are behind Chelsea. All right, we have to play against them and so do Arsenal, so we can lay pressure on Chelseaâs shoulders. You never know. Youâve seen it in previous Premier League seasons â¦â
He will need his team to buck a trend and click from the outset at the Bridge if the first wound is to be inflicted. Van Gaal conceded his side âhavenât played well for 90 minutesâ under his stewardship, citing even the opening 15 minutes against City as slack. They will travel without Michael Carrick, Daley Blind, Phil Jones, Jonny Evans and Marcos Rojo, surely weakening their challenge. âI disagree because their squad is amazing, in numbers, players, experience, solutions,â offered Mourinho. âEvery week in my office we put up on the big screen the squad and the options our opponents will have. When I looked this week, for the first time I realised what they have. Itâs amazing.â
One of their options is Juan Mata, a player sold by Chelsea as part of their new policy of balancing lavish purchases with heftier sales. So does Uefaâs financial fair play now play into Unitedâs hands? âYes, itâs easier for them,â Mourinho said. âIt was easier before at he Portuguese insisted this seasonâs race, for all its lack of variety at the top, had been tougher than ever, with the challenge offered up from teams in mid-table, or even those near the foot, rendering everything a grind. Which makes him all the more baffled, even after six defeats in eight games, by the recent criticism of Cityâs manager, âI donât understand. On the one hand people want competitiveness in this country and you donât like a team to win two titles in a row or be dominant. You want lots of teams fighting for the title. OK, they wonât win the Premier League this time but they did last year. Some managers cannot win and âlife goes onâ but the guys at While tacit praise for Pellegrini may simply have been an indication Mourinho does not consider City under the Chileanâs stewardship a threat, there was a thinly veiled poke at Wenger in that argument. That suggests the buildup to the trip to Arsenal next weekend could be spikier but, for now, the angst is all elsewhere. Chelsea are 11 points from their first title in five years. Those at their back can only live in hope.
