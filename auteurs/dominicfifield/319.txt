Costa, a £32m signing from Atlético Madrid this summer, is unable to play twice in four days at present after consistently suffering discomfort in his left hamstring. The injury had flared up in a friendly win against France earlier this month to rule him out of the second of Spainâs matches, a qualifier against Macedonia, and requires a period of rest to heal properly. Ideally, Chelsea would like him to enjoy a break during the forthcoming international window.
Yet, unless the forward suffers a relapse against Villa, Sporting Lisbon or Arsenal in the games ahead, they are braced for Costa to be called up for Spainâs games in Slovakia and Luxembourg on 9 and 12 October. âIâm nobody to make that decision,â said Mourinho when asked if he would hope to persuade âEverything is clear. Everybody knows what is going on with Diego. Everyone knows heâs been in trouble for quite a long time. But the moment a national team wants to select a âThey can call up the players, play them, do what they want. Itâs completely out of my control. What I think and what I feel doesnât play a part. We can communicate [with the federation], send exams and reports, but itâs their decision in the end. After the game against Arsenal, or even before that when they make the pre-selection, everything is in their hands. I can do nothing.â
Costa was rested for Wednesdayâs Capital One Cup win over Bolton Wanderers as he had been in the Champions League against Schalke a week earlier. But, having scored seven goals in five Premier League appearances to date, he will start against third-placed Villa at Stamford Bridge despite Chelsea travelling to Lisbon on Monday for their European tie against Sporting.
âHe plays tomorrow and starts the game without problems,â added Mourinho, who will be without Ramires until after the international break after the midfielder suffered a groin injury. âThe question is always the same: can he finish the game and be in condition to play in Lisbon 48 hours later? That I donât know.
âEveryone is working hard to help Diego. He is the first to do that, too. Heâs working hard in his recovery, with the medical staff and the conditioning staff, trying to be ready for every game. Mentally, heâs ready for every game. Physically heâs not. Everyone is trying hard for him to be able to play every game.
âBut, at this moment, because I donât think about Sporting or the Champions League, I think about Villa in the Premier League and he plays for sure. Heâs in a good position to start. If he doesnât play against Sporting, I play [Didier] Drogba or [Loïc] Rémy. But thatâs another game, another story. I play tomorrow with the team I think is the best to win against Villa. After that, I will face the consequences.â
