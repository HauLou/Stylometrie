José Mourinho considers Chelsea passed up a chance to move eight points clear of Manchester City, and nine ahead of Arsène Wengerâs side, by drawing 1-1 with 
Asked if he considered teams other than Manchester City to be in contention for the title, the Chelsea manager said: âOf course [Arsenal are] as they are seven points behind, even if they have one less match to play than Mourinho initially suggested he would not comment upon Mike Deanâs decision to award Southampton a penalty, the official showing Nemanja Matic a yellow card for what he considered to be a foul on Sadio Mané. The clearer contact actually appeared to be Branislav Ivanovicâs push on the Southampton player. Yet the manager revisited the incident when explaining his subsequent decision to substitute Matic, the Serb having escaped a second yellow card for a trip on the same player in the opening exchanges of the second period.
âWhen that penalty is given you have to believe that the second yellow could come,â he said. âWith fast players like Mané coming out of midfield, driving the ball, that could happen. If you remember Ramiresâs red card against Aston Villa last season, obviously you are afraid of it.
âI went to Sky and they told me that their pundits said it was a penalty. I went to the BBC and they said it wasnât a penalty. I went to the radio and they said it wasnât. Now I come here and I think I understand youâre saying itâs not a penalty. There are different perspectives. But what is important is Mr Mike Dean, and his decision was a penalty.â
The Southampton manager, Ronald Koeman, said: âIn the second half there was a foul [Matic on Mané] that maybe could be a yellow card, which would have been his second one. But Iâm not supporting referees showing eight, nine, 10 yellows every game. You need to be straight in every situation, and thatâs very difficult. The referee did a great job today.âThe home sideâs own appeal for a spot-kick, when Tadic clipped Ivanovic, was waved away. Asked if he thought his side would benefit from a penalty award again this season, Mourinho said: âItâs a question. Itâs a question. Itâs a question.â
