Arsène Wenger has condemned the racist abuse that a black Parisian commuter was subjected to by a group of Three fans filmed as part of a crowd caught chanting that they liked being racist, moments after the commuter was repeatedly shoved from a train carriage, have since been suspended from entering club grounds. Chelsea, who have not identified the individuals, have stressed culprits could face a lifetime ban from Stamford Bridge with French prosecutors warning those found guilty of racist offences could face three years in jail.
âIt looked pathetic and dreadful,â said Wenger when asked about the incident. âUnfortunately we have a recurrence of that always. But we have to be extremely severe with any incident of that calibre. Itâs societyâs problem [and not just footballâs]. Look, more intelligent people than myself have thought about that and nobody has found a miraculous solution. It starts from childhood and education, and an open-minded attitude.
âThereâs a danger of having radical people in every society. Look, since Iâve observed youth movements, there are always a number of people ready for radical solutions. Most of the time you have to control them. I donât think anyone agrees with that kind of behaviour. Everybody has to fight against that. Why should we not? You have to be 100% against that. Itâs absolutely ridiculous.â
