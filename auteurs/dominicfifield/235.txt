Clarke was dismissed as head coach at West Bromwich Albion last December, despite finishing eighth the previous season, after leading the team to only seven wins in 34 Premier League games in 2013. The 51-year-old had been in the frame to take over at Crystal Palace this season only to lose out to Neil Warnock at the last, but now returns to the dugout in the second tier.

Nigel Adkins worked tirelessly to achieve success, sadly it did not work out for him but we wish him, his family and staff well for the future.

Reading have adjusted their outlay to comply with the Football Leagueâs new financial fair play regulations but the manager will have funds to spend in January. An agreement is in place in principle to secure the Palace striker Glenn Murray, who has been on loan at the club since August, for around £1.5m with Clarke to assess the current playing staff before deciding whether to enter the market further.

Clarkeâs first game in charge will be ahome fixture against sixth-placed Watford on Saturday.
