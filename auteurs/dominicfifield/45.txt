Hugo Lloris has admitted there comes a time âto think about yourselfâ as he considers his future at Tottenham Hotspur, though the France international appears to have ruled out a return to Ligue 1 with The Spurs goalkeeper, an £8m arrival from Lyon in 2012, signed a new five-year contract at the end of last season but has long made it clear to the clubâs chairman, Daniel Levy, that he wants to play in the Champions League, where he featured in each of his four years at his previous club. The France captainâs time at White Hart Lane has failed to yield a return to Europeâs elite competition, with Tottenhamâs fifth-place finish last term ensuring another campaign in the Europa League awaits.

Lloris, in an interview with LâEquipe published on Tuesday, stressed his relations with Levy remain strong but the goalkeeper was far from dismissive of suggestions the time may have now come to move on amid mooted interest from Manchester United should, as expected, David de Gea leave for Real Madrid. France host the European Championship next summer and the goalkeeper is well aware that he is one of the few players in Didier Deschampsâ squad who is not at a Champions League club.
Should the uncertainty extend into August and the new campaign, however, then his commitment to Tottenham would not waver. âYou donât know what could happen,â said Lloris. âThere is one important thing: there is a moment to think about yourself, to sit down and reflect, but when that moment has passed and the season starts, youâre fully committed to the clubâs project and to the team [youâre with].â Asked if that moment to reflect had now come, he added with a smile: âVoilà. But you donât control everything.â
The goalkeeper, who insisted he had no regrets about joining Spurs with his three years in London constituting a valuable and worthwhile period in his development, confirmed there is no buy-out clause in his current contract, whether to clubs involved in the Champions League or not. He did, however, hint at the existence of a gentlemanâs agreement with Levy that may have been struck when the last contract was signed. â[Talk about a clause] doesnât correspond with reality,â he said. âThere is no clause. I have always liked to have face-to-face talks with my bosses. Itâs important to get to know people, to get an idea of the culture of a club, and to understand how it works.
âWhen you have that privilege of being able to talk directly with your chairman, like Iâve had with Daniel Levy, that make things a lot easier. Afterwards, I know what weâve said to each other, and we have a relationship built on trust. All this talk of fees doesnât really interest me. Honestly, itâs a debate for clubs to have. No one has told me how much Iâm worth, and Iâm not trying to find out. But weâre in a period where things are sometimes whipped up for nothing, where numbers are bandied around to sound out the market. Itâs the way it works.â
While United have monitored his situation closely in anticipation of losing De Gea, PSG would appear to be less of an option for Lloris. âYou can never say never, but my ideas are clear in my mind and are the same as when I was 16 or 18 years old,â he said. âTomorrow, I donât know. But today, Iâm of a different state of mind. This is only my personal opinion, but I think it would be very hard to dislodge [Salvatore] Sirigu.
âI donât know if they [the rumours about a move to the French capital] were to destabilise PSG at an important stage of their season, but I think heâs done great things for that club and people have short memories. Again, that club is progressing. We can all feel them evolving. But, for me today, the question [of a move back to France] has not arisen.â
