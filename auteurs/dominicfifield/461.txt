So the guessing game will go on even if, in reality, only late injury or illness is likely to deny nine of this team their start in Amazonia. On the assumption Jordan Hendersonâs familiarity with Steven Gerrardâs game earns him the second central midfield berth, only the wide positions feel vaguely up for grabs. The manager had also spoken of âimpact playersâ in the buildup to this fixture, bracketing Sterling with Oxlade-Chamberlain and Ross Barkley, with his implication clear that any of that trio could be flung on from the bench to stretch tiring opponents. In that context, this was a final audition for the starters, even with their rhythm so disrupted by the bruising of the skies and resultant thunderstorm break. With James Milner on the bench, Lallana still appears happier trotting infield, his willingness to swap with Wayne Rooney allowing him spells operating as the No10 in a central playmaking role whenever the Manchester United forward sought possession nearer the flank. Much has been made of Rickie Lambertâs whirlwind elevation in recent years, from League Two to Liverpool, but Lallanaâs is similar. He was a player from the third tier of the domestic game the last time England graced a World Cup, and had still not played in the Premier League as the national side departed for Euro 2012. Now, after two impressive campaigns in the elite, he is the subject of a £25m bid from Liverpool, who feel he can be incorporated seamlessly into their fluid system.
The 26-year-old had been becalmed before the storm, perhaps reflecting the general mood of trepidation given a late injury might dash a dream. But he was briefly revived by the 43-minute break, his clever shimmy and shifting of the ball to eke space from Maynor Figueroa and Victor Bernárdez allowing him a sight of goal from just outside the area with his attempt deflected just wide. He worked almost solely infield thereafter, though Barkleyâs cameo still rather eclipsed the Southampton playerâs efforts. The youngster from Everton is bolder, and therefore riskier, in possession. Lallana may have been booked for swinging a leg out at Roger Espinoza, but he still feels a safer option.
Then there was Welbeck. The United forward remains an enigma. At club level his 10-goal tally this season was one of his better returns, though he actually managed only one in 15 games after 11 January, with his season soured by a notable miss against Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarter-final on April Foolâs Day. His return for England is far more productive, with eight in 20 under Hodgson and, more significantly, five in 12 competitive contests under this manager. He is trusted: Hodgson values his energy, pace and scoring knack at this level, but also his industry. He knows the 23-year-old will follow defensive instructions whether positioned through the middle or out on the left. Those qualities work in his favour.
Welbeck was more of a touchline hugger for periods here, confronting Brayan Beckeles when he summoned momentum, and linking smartly with Rooney and Sturridge on occasion. It was his dart and pass, then clever dummy, which liberated Sturridge just before the referee paused the contest midway through the opening period, with the lone striker dragging his shot wide of Noel Valladaresâ post. Welbeck had summoned the first effort of note in the game by then, forcing the jittery Honduran goalkeeper to push away an early attempt. He poked another shot into Valladaresâ chest just before the hour-mark after Lallanaâs dribble had been suffocated in the clutter of bodies just inside the box.
The main criticism of this display was that, at times, he appeared to be trying too hard, his eagerness to impress prompting one touch or turn too many with the ball run out of play or possession surrendered. A goal would have settled his nerves, reassuring him that he belongs. That will now have to come in Brazil. The reality is he will most likely be granted his chance to impress in Manaus though, by then, Hodgson will have the option of throwing Sterling into the fray late on. He may be needed to inject forward thrust into this selection.
