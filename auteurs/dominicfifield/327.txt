José Mourinho has admitted Costa, who has scored seven times in his four Premier League starts including a hat-trick against Swansea on Saturday, was restricted to a late cameo from the bench against Schalke as Mourinho was intent on ensuring the £32m signing from Atlético Madrid is fit enough to feature in Sundayâs trip to the champions, Manchester City.
âHe has a problem and he canât play, in this moment, three matches in a week,â said the manager, who selected Didier Drogba in Costaâs stead. âIf he has one week to let the muscle recover he can start again like he was before he had that problem with the national team. But three days, after Saturday, is not enough.
âNot selecting him here was not to protect him for the game for Sunday, but because today he was not in the condition after Saturday. He had a problem in the national team, not with us. And now we have a problem and have to resolve it as best we can. He was not fit enough to start against Schalke. On Sunday we believe he will be. Next week against Bolton [in the Capital One Cup], for sure he wonât be. We have to manage the situation until the moment heâs completely fine. I donât know [how long that will be]. But, if today he had started the game, for sure he could not play on Sunday. We have to go step by step.â
