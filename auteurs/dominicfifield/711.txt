Branislav Ivanovic believes Chelsea are in their best position to mount a prolonged assault on the Premier League title since they last clinched the championship three years ago but has urged his team-mates to be "careful" in maintaining high standards over the congested schedule to come.
José Mourinho's side recovered from a conceded goal after 13 seconds to overcome an impressive Southampton at Stamford Bridge on Sunday and moved clear into second place, four points off the leaders, Arsenal. The game was the first of 10 in a month in all competitions, a sequence that culminates in a trip to St Mary's on New Year's Day, which will go some way towards determining whether Chelsea can wrest back the title from the Manchester clubs.
"At this stage in the years before [since winning the title in 2010] we would always be trailing by a lot of points but we are up there now and this has given us an opportunity," said Ivanovic. "It's a good thing when you go into each game feeling you are there and right at the top. It's not like last year, where we had to run for the points and it put us under pressure, and made everything much more difficult. We have improved as a team but we have to show it every game. At the moment, this is our best chance since 2010 but we have to be careful and carry on, fighting for every game and every point."
Chelsea's standing in the table is their best at this stage since their last title-winning campaign, in 2009, when they were top and two points clear of Manchester United in the first week of December. They have been 10 points adrift of the summit at this point in the last two years, in third place under Rafael Benítez and fourth under André Villas-Boas. The exception came in 2010 when Carlo Ancelotti's side, while midway through the Italian's infamous "bad moment", were still third at this stage and apparently in contention, two points shy of the top, even if their form was actually still deteriorating. Fast forward to mid-January, however, and that deficit had widened to nine.
Mourinho's team travel to Wearside on Wednesday to confront Sunderland in the first of three matches against teams currently threatened with relegation â Stoke and Crystal Palace follow â before their trip to the leaders, Arsenal, two days before Christmas. "In December, you can definitely see how this league is so hard," added Ivanovic. "It provides one of the main references for how strong your team is and if it's tough enough to win the title. It's important for us during these physical games to win and get the points.
"Before the start, we said the league was going to be very equal and difficult, with a lot of teams having the ability to win it. Five or six teams can win the league and that makes it extremely hard. In seasons before, it was always a battle between two or three teams, who from the beginning would get points and make a gap. Now, it's tight between everyone and there are going to be more and more exciting games and it's going to be a very tough season.
"It was a good sign on Sunday but when we win one game we always start speaking about winning the title. It was a good performance, the second half especially, but we have to go game by game, we have to try to win a couple of matches on the road [Sunderland and Stoke] and that will give us an advantage. Southampton was a really, really hard game and it would have been even if we hadn't conceded after 13 seconds. It was nice to win this kind of game but we also have to be careful because sometimes when you lose concentration like we did at the start, it can hurt you in terms of points.
"This team has the character to do things like that definitely but it's important to show that every game, to be at our top level every match. Even when we don't play at our best, we must take the points and play with good personality. We showed that against Southampton but there is a long way still to go. We have a very busy December and it is important for us to recover and be ready for the next battle, as if nothing happened before."
