José Mourinho described Didier Drogba as âremarkableâ after the veteran striker excelled while deputising for the suspended Diego Costa as Chelsea equalled a club record 23-match unbeaten run by defeating Tottenham Hotspur.
Drogba, who had returned to the club in the summer on a free transfer, provided an assist for Eden Hazardâs opening goal and then converted his teamâs second to ensure Costa was not missed in Wednesdayâs derby. The substitute Loïc Rémy scored his first league goal for the club 17 minutes from time to complete the win and leave Spurs without a win at Stamford Bridge in 28 attempts dating back to 1990.
âHeâs remarkable,â said Mourinho of Drogba, who had departed â[My team] played against him when I was at Real Madrid and also with Chelsea, last year, so I could feel the kind of potential he still has. I was expecting exactly this [impact]. And there was not even a doubt in my mind about a player who would not be playing every game like before [in his first eight-year spell at the club]. I knew that, from a mental point of view, he would adapt very well to this role, which is so important in the team.â
Mourinho expects Drogba to take on a role at the club â either on the coaching staff or with an ambassadorial brief â when he decides to retire as a player, with the 36-year-old having signed a one-year deal at Stamford Bridge last summer. âThe important thing is he is here and will finish his career with Chelsea,â said the manager. âIt looks, for me, that heâs going to stay doing other things when he finishes his career. I donât know if this will be his last season as a player. It must be his decision. He came here to stay, I want him to stay, the club want him to stay. It will be his decision when he decides when he must stop as a player. Something personal.â
Costa will return from a one-match ban for Saturdayâs game at Newcastle, where Nemanja Matic will now be suspended after picking up a fifth booking of the season. Mikel John Obi would be the Serbâs most obvious replacement. âBut it is not a problem, no problem,â added Mourinho, whose side remain six points clear at the top. â[We will] play another one, like we did with Diego Costa.
