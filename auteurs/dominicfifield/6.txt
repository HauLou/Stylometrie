Turan, a Turkey international boasting 81 caps, intends to make a decision this week over his future having indicated the time has come to leave Vicente Calderón. Atlético have two firm bids for his services already on the table, with Barcelona â whose current transfer embargo would complicate any move this summer â The midfielder, who is understood to be attracted to the possibility of moving to London, has a £29m buyout clause inserted in his current contract, though it is unlikely that figure will have to be met in full when he leaves. Chelsea could potentially offer the Brazil left-back Filipe Luís a return to Atlético as part of any deal, the defender having failed to settle or make a consistent impact since his own £16m arrival from the Spanish club last summer.
Turan was an £8.5m signing from Galatasaray four years ago and, having made 178 appearances and scored 22 goals, has played an integral part in the success enjoyed by Atlético under Diego Simeone, which includes success in La Liga, the Copa del Rey, the Europa League and as beaten finalists in the 2014 Champions League. The playerâs agent, Ahmet Bulut, suggested earlier this week that a move was imminent for his client.
âA lot of things about his transfer are being published but not everything they say is true,â he told NTVSpor. âWe want to clarify that at this time there is a lot of pressure about this situation but we donât want to make a formal statement about his destination before he signs. That being said, in the next four days Arda will decide which team heâll play for next season.â
Bulut added that Atlético had reluctantly accepted Turanâs decision to depart. âOur decision really surprised Atlético Madrid,â he said. âThey donât want Arda to leave and were persistent but in the end, they respected and accepted our decision. But of course, nothing is completely done until he signs. However, we made sure the message was clear that we wanted to leave Atlético.â The Spanish club may enter the race for Dniproâs Yevhen Konoplyanka as they seek a replacement for the Turkey international.
Griezmann, who enjoyed a productive first season at Atlético following five years at Real Sociedad, had emerged early as a Chelsea target this summer though his own buyout clause is set at £43m, with the Spanish club reluctant to part with him at this stage. The 24-year-old is an option to whom the Premier League champions could return in future, particularly given the close relationship they enjoy with the hierarchy at Vicente Calderón.
There has been interest expressed at Stamford Bridge in Atléticoâs Toby Alderweireld, who spent last season on loan at Southampton, though Chelsea may now opt not to pursue a deal. The Belgian international remains available but is also coveted by Tottenham Hotspur, with a return to St Maryâs also possible. The Spanish club are selling their Brazilian centre-half Miranda, 30, to Internazionale for a little over £10m and will sign Portoâs Colombia forward, Jackson Martínez, for £24.8m.
