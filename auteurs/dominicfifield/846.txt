Even by Arsenal's recent standards a sense of crisis has gripped early. A club who have accrued one and two points respectively from their August fixtures in the past two seasons find themselves engulfed in gloom after a solitary loss this time round, a summer's ambitious pledges exposed to date as empty promises.
The squad travel to Istanbul for a Normally this might be a time to summon a sense of perspective. Arsène Wenger would remind the watching world of his side's two-legged victory over awkward Italian opponents in Udinese two years ago, victories achieved while their domestic form spluttered and, indeed, wins that were still pursued by that infamous 8-2 drubbing at Manchester United. might argue that no campaign is wrecked by an opening-day defeat, even if it is a first at home in 20 years. And he would insist there remains time for money to be spent and for the squad to be strengthened, as the exposure of a flurry of offers for players in the wake of the 3-1 loss to Aston Villa seems to suggest.
The problem is those familiar arguments sound tired. This summer was supposed to be different, the moment Arsenal accepted the way of the modern world and challenged to sign the biggest names on the market while those teams above them endured managerial upheaval. It was an opportunity. They had £150m in the bank and, according to the chief executive Ivan Gazidis, the "escalation in financial firepower" was allied with a desire to make waves in the market.
Yet ever since that ambition was made public, life has been about knock-backs, with every attempt to break their transfer record frustrated. Bayer Leverkusen's Lars Bender could not be signed for £18.5m. Interest was expressed in Luiz Gustavo, who was initially keen to join, only to end up opting to move to Wolfsburg for £17m.
Napoli ended up signing Gonzalo Higuaín for £32m, a striker Wenger had been keen to buy for £23m only to opt to pursue Liverpool's Luis Suárez instead, though that whole sorry tale has come to epitomise the summer's toils. The Argentinian looked the ideal addition but he was effectively allowed to slip through the net as the £40,000,001 bid for Suárez, an offer designed to test a threshold in the Uruguayan's contract and spark negotiations, did not trigger the supposed clause.
Suárez remains not for sale, with the whole episode adding to the sense of farce. Should Wenger still succeed in adding up to four players in the fortnight that remains before the deadline then, inevitably, it will suggest only that panic has set in, provoking a repeat of the desperate scattergun of 2011 when the arrivals of Mikel Arteta, Park Chu-young, Per Mertesacker and Andre Santos were not evidence of considered, long-term planning. Indeed, the bid for Yohan Cabaye, classy when on form but another ball-playing midfielder, hints the panic has already set in.
Wenger will take much of the blame, his yearning for perfection and reluctance to pay over the odds â even in a market where Edinson Cavani costs £48m and Radamel Falcao £55m â retained despite the wealth his club have generated. It was the Frenchman who suffered the chants on the touchline on Saturday evening, his argument over limited availability damaged by Tottenham Hotspur's more efficient strengthening over the close season.
Whoever misled the board over Suárez, too, is culpable. Some level of naivety influenced that fiasco, prompting those familiar arguments over the lack of a David Dein-type figure on the current board. He departed his role as vice-chairman in 2007 but his reputation as a man who made a difference grows with every anti-climactic transfer window. "Bring Davie Dein [back] and give [Alisher] Usmanov representation on the board if we are to have success going forward," tweeted Nina Bracewell-Smith on Sunday night. She had sold her 15.9% stake in the club to Stan Kroenke two years ago, allowing the American to become majority shareholder in the process. Her tweets, since deleted, went on to express "regret" at that sale.
There is an irony, of course, that Wenger has succeeded in one of his tasks this summer in clearing the squad of much of the perceived deadwood â the likes of Gervinho, Vito Mannone, Marouane Chamakh, Sebastien Squillaci, Andre Santos, Denilson, Andriy Arshavin and Johan Djourou have all moved on â Yet, with only Yaya Sanogo arriving, on a free transfer from Auxerre, the collective suddenly feels weakened. Cue the inevitable raft of early-season injuries, from Arteta to Thomas Vermaelen, Nacho Monreal to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, and suddenly the manager is struggling even to fill his substitutes' bench. Fenerbahce will not fear their visitors' strength in depth at the Sukru Saracoglu stadium on Wednesday.
All that remains is a mess, with unrest welling back home as a fragile team travels east. Everything about the Gunners' approach this summer has been muddled. Even suggestions that Wenger will be offered a new contract to extend his stay beyond 2014 no longer look like PR coups. The Arsenal Supporters' Trust stressed as much by claiming any deal would feel "inappropriate" before the dust has settled on this transfer window.
Those who pay the hefty ticket prices at the Emirates are disgruntled and elimination by the Turks is unthinkable in more ways than one. Wenger may roll out his positives upon arrival in Istanbul once more but a summer of exasperation has choked this campaign in its infancy. Faith is being eroded.
