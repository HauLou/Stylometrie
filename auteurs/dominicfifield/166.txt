The team displaying the most consistency are Liverpool, a side unbeaten in their past 10 league games stretching to mid-December when they were traumatised by their brush with the Of the others, Arsenal probably have the greatest array of options, a squad who consistently compete in the knockout phases of the Champions League with an array of attacking-midfield and forward options at their disposal. Injuries across the backline would leave them more stretched, but they have learned to cope when depleted already this season and while they appear short of being title challengers, they are probably the best of the rest on paper.
Both Liverpool, who had done just that last season, appeared frail at the back earlier this term and their forward signings took considerable time to adjust, but they have struck on a system that ekes the best out of their personnel.
Southampton added midfield and forward bodies over the winter but still rely heavily on Morgan Schneiderlinâs presence in the centre. Over-reliance on one influential figure is risky, and they may lack options up front, where Graziano Pellè has scored once in 12 and Jay Rodriguez is still missed. He has been coveted by Tottenham for a while and Mauricio Pochettinoâs squad can seem stretched. Runs in the Europa League and Capital One Cup have tested their strength â their involvement in both might have been curtailed by Sunday evening â with the reliance clear on Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen. While interest is retained in different competitions they may rely rather too uncomfortably on players from the Arsenalâs run-in might appear the least daunting, with home games against Chelsea and Liverpool and the trickiest trip to one of the other contenders, at Old Trafford on the penultimate weekend. Certainly, their home fixtures appear very winnable, while Southampton will also be encouraged by what lies ahead. They must visit the top two, with City on the final afternoon, but there are seven fixtures against clubs involved in the scrap at the bottom. To date, Koemanâs team have imposed their class on such opponents.
Tottenham will hope to inflict damage at Old Trafford and at St Maryâs against direct rivals, and have only one derby with which to contend in their final 12 games. Manchester United, in contrast, face Spurs, Liverpool, City and Chelsea in a five-game sequence which will potentially determine the fate of their campaign.
Then there is Liverpool. At first glance, their run-in appears awkward at best, with the top two as well as United and Arsenal lying in wait. But recent history, and new-found momentum, may work in their favour. In the two seasons Rodgers has overseen the side, Liverpool have played 58 games before 31 December, winning 26 but losing 18. Their record from 1 January to the end reads 44 matches, 29 wins and only four defeats. Three of those were against United, West Bromwich Albion and Southampton in his first season. They are a team who tend to find their rhythm late. As the manager stated on Sunday, the run-in does not hold too many fears.
Where Arsenal and their manager, Arsène Wenger, have grown accustomed to timing their run to a top-four finish, Tottenham have become rather familiar with missing out late-on.
They have slipped from the perch they had enjoyed 12 games from the end of each of the past three seasons so under the new management of Pochettino, any higher finish than their current seventh would actually represent progress.
While Southampton are in uncharted territory, albeit under the stewardship of a manager who has upset the established order previously in his coaching career, Liverpool will lean heavily on memories of last season when there were 11 successive league wins before the infamous and costly slips in the spring.
Yet, if any of the sides in the race should be able to count on experience to see them home it is the United team of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie, Michael Carrick and, above all, Louis van Gaal. The Dutchmanâs reputation precedes him and it remains rather baffling that his time at Old Trafford has appeared to lack pattern and long-term strategy. Yet salvage Champions League football from the run-in and this campaign can be put down to transition before a return to the elite. The weight of his experience must tell.
Logic suggests Arsenal should secure a 19th consecutive top-four finish, with Liverpool the likeliest to oust Manchester United from the Champions League places. However, the sheer number of meetings to come between those currently ranked between third and seventh should maintain the drama to the wire
