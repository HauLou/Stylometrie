The former Montpellier forward has scored 17 goals in all competitions, recently scoring in six successive Premier League games as Arsenal mustered an eight-match winning streak. Yet Henry clearly remains unconvinced as to his compatriotâs ability and, in his capacity as a pundit on Sky at Sundayâs goalless draw with âTo get second in the league and win the FA Cup would be a great season,â Giroud said. âI know we can still improve ourselves and that is what we have been doing since I signed for 
âIt has been a few years since we finished second and, if we can do it, we can see an improvement, which is great. Next year, hopefully, we will have fewer injuries, will keep the same group and, with maybe one or two new players, we will have a great season I am sure.
âAs for myself, in sport you have to question yourself every week and be ready in your head and you have to be at 100% of determination if you want to keep going and win games; you cannot afford to be at 80% or 90%. You have to have faith in your own qualities, that is part of being a footballer: being strong in your head. That is more than half of the quality you need to be a football player.â
The France international conceded that this seasonâs race was over as Arsenal have failed to eat into Chelseaâs 10-point advantage at the top. Giroud admitted grudging respect for the manner in which the leaders secured their point at the Emirates Stadium, to a chorus of âboring, boring Chelseaâ from the home support, with their consistency having left them on the verge of a first title in five years.
âBoring? I donât know but there is the table which speaks for them,â he said. âIt is true maybe they are not [playing] the same game as us but we are not going to change our game and I think they are not going to change their game. I think they are pleased with that and if they are champions, what can you say?â
