José Mourinho and Rafael Benítez back in the summer of 2004. This was the old order against the Benítez and Mourinho had arrived in English football in the summer of 2004 with the Portuguese swiftly initialising a move for the Liverpool captain, Steven Gerrard, as a statement of Chelseaâs intent. Liverpool resisted â the issue would be revisited the following year â but the enmity between the clubs was instantly established. That seasonâs League Cup final became a flashpoint in waiting.
Benítezâs team scored in the opening attack but, 11 minutes from time, Gerrard leapt with John Arne Riise and Jamie Carragher and inadvertently guided Paulo Ferreiraâs looped free-kick beyond Jerzy Dudek and into the net. Mourinho walked along the touchline in front of the âIt was a nightmare,â Gerrard subsequently said. âI felt suicidal. It was bad, one of the worst days I have had, especially against Fixtures between the two had become a chorus of taunts about âplastic flagsâ and a perceived âlack of historyâ, or retorts over rivals being âancient historyâ with contests a reminder that Roman Abramovichâs money was challenging the long-established order in the English game. Mourinho and Benítez tapped into the antipathy with glee. The Champions League semi-finals that first year were tight with a goalless first leg at Stamford Bridge, only for Luis García to poke a loose ball goalwards four minutes into the second game. William Gallas hacked it clear but, with the din inside Anfield deafening, the goal was awarded.
Chelsea whipped up furious late pressure but could not squeeze parity, with a furious Mourinho later describing Garcíaâs decisive intervention as a âghost goalâ. âThey didnât score â their supporters did,â he said. Even this weekend he admitted: âA goal that was not a goal like that stays with you forever,â while fretting about the reality that goal-line technology is not available in the Benítez, whose team went on to claim the clubâs fifth European Cup in Istanbul two months later, revelled in the victory. âJosé and I were really good friends until Liverpool started beating them,â he said. âSince then he seems to have changed his mind.â
Mourinho had left Chelsea earlier that season after 16 matches in all competitions with Benítezâs Liverpool in a little over three years. Avram Grant was installed as the Chelsea manager in his stead. Another Champions League semi-final, a third in four seasons, saw the teams draw 1-1 at Anfield courtesy of Riiseâs last-minute own-goal with tensions inflamed before the second leg when Benítez suggested Didier Drogba was a âdiverâ.
The Ivorian duly opened the scoring in the second leg, running the length of the half to celebrate in front of the Liverpool manager. âIt was very personal what he said,â the striker would go on to say. âIâm doing everything I can to promote English football and Iâm doing my best. I was disappointed to hear that.â
Fernando Torresâs equaliser took the contest into extra-time only for an emotional Frank Lampard, who had lost his mother the previous week, to convert a 98th-minute penalty and Drogba to add a third. Despite Ryan Babelâs late consolation, Chelsea had bucked the trend against the Merseysiders in this competition.
Benítez had accepted Abramovichâs invitation to take over at Chelsea on an interim basis but, while the build-up to this occasion had been dominated by his return to Anfield, it was Luis Suárez who ended up hogging the limelight.
Trailing 2-1 after the Uruguayan had handled to concede a penalty from which the visitors edged ahead, frustration took the better of Suárez, who tussled with Branislav Ivanovic at the other end and sunk his teeth into the Serbâs upper arm.
The referee, Kevin Friend, spoke to both players and even examined the marks left on the defender but no sanction was taken at the time. Suárez later received a 10-match ban. He apologised to Ivanovic, admitting he had been guilty of âinexcusable behaviourâ. âI am truly very sorry,â he said in a statement. âI hope that all the people who I have offended will grant me forgiveness.â
The rivalry effectively turned full circle last April. Mourinho returned to the fixture with his club outsiders in a three-team title pursuit in the wake of a wasteful defeat by Sunderland and with Liverpool enjoying the momentum and destiny in their own hands. Victory would have made a first league title since 1990 feel a formality. Even a draw would have preserved a slender lead at the top with two games to play. Defeat decisively undermined their challenge.
Not for the first time in fixtures involving Mourinho and those on Merseyside, Gerrard became the gameâs pivotal figure. Just before half-time the home captain allowed Mamadou Sakhoâs pass to roll under his foot, the midfielder slipping as he attempted to rectify matters and watching grim-faced as Demba Ba raced clear to thrust the visitors ahead. Willianâs second in injury time confirmed the worst and Mourinho, for his part, had told his players the entire country had viewed them as âclowns in the circusâ before that game, incidental figures who had effectively blown their own chances against Sunderland. He revelled in a victory back in an arena where he had suffered as often as he had prospered. This fixture retained its spite.
