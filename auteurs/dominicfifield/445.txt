At least This had felt like a significant moment. All the talk from within the England camp in the build-up had been of this as an opportunity for the 28-year-old to establish his qualities at a World Cup finals after those infamous false starts in Germany and South Africa. His mood was buoyant, his determination to âenjoyâ this tournament expressed publicly â it was almost possible to detect Dr Steve Petersâ input in the forwardâs comments back at Urca â and indicative of maturity, according to Hodgson, with all that experience so critical in a squad of relative rookies. He was one of only three starters in Manaus who had played in these finals before. Italy included three And yet, on this pivotal occasion, he began not as the teamâs focal point up front, or even as its principal playmaker in the hole, but out on the left. This is the role he has detested at times at Manchester United, even if he has toed the line when asked about it since linking up with the national squad. âIâve been doing it for years,â he had offered. âIf you look at the way we play, itâs not playing out and out on the left wing. Youâre playing more inside, youâre coming inside off the line. Itâs not really playing too much on the left.â That much was true, but Raheem Sterlingâs pace and fearless approach was more valued through the middle and, at times, it still felt as if Rooney had been rather awkwardly shoehorned into the team because, without him, Perhaps, psychologically, they would have been against such canny opponents, but there were still long periods when he was far too peripheral here, for all that Englandâs front four interchanged with relish. Where Danny Welbeck and Sterling were eager sprinters, disconcerting their markers with their darts into space, Rooney paced the area between Matteo Darmian and Antonio Candreva craving involvement. Aside from a couple of accurately clipped cross-field passes to Welbeck on the right, he had been anonymous until Claudio Marchisio skimmed the The concession served as a wake-up call. Rooney, who had possibly unsighted Joe Hart on the edge of the six-yard box as the shot was fizzed in, spent the plod back to the halfway line for the re-start furiously geeing up his team-mates as if roused from his slumbers. Within seconds he had collected Sterlingâs fine pass to ease beyond Darmian and cross for Sturridge to convert on the half-volley at the far post.
With a record of 39 goals in 93 caps, of course, Rooney might hope to have led the line as the principle forward and there were shots pinged marginally wide of each post as this game progressed. Yet throughout all the experimentation in Portugal to Florida to Rio de Janeiro, the one certainty in this England attacking quartet team had been Sturridge. The 24-year-old has been the constant, his eye-catching campaign at Liverpool demanding involvement from the start. Only Luis Suárez, Cristiano Ronaldo, Diego Costa, Lionel Messi and Ciro Immobile had mustered more than his 21 league goals across Europeâs elite divisions and, even if his equaliser here was only his sixth reward at this level, this tournament has come to feel like his opportunity. Gary Lineker boasted only six upon arriving in Mexico in 1986, but went on to secure the Golden Boot and never looked back.
Hodgson had volunteered comparisons with a teenage Pelé back in 1958 when speaking of Sturridge on the eve of this game. âDaniel is a natural talent, an extremely gifted player,â Hodgson said on the eve of this game, his captain Steven Gerrard having also recently taken to reminding his club-mate of his qualities, behind the scenes. Admittedly, there was a naivety to the forwardâs hoodwinking by Andreaâs Pirloâs dummy in the build-up to Marchisioâs opener, and he can become anxious when games are veering away, but Sturridgeâs prowess is better gauged at the other end.
No England player has managed more than two goals at a World Cup since Lineker in 1990. He would back himself to become the first with his instinct always to shoot, that waspish left foot forever a threat as Salvatore Sirigu quickly discovered. The Italy goalkeeper smartly pushed away an attempt early in the second period when the scores were still level, Sirigu later alarmed and scampering across his line as Sturridge curled an attempt marginally wide of the far post. His departure did at least push Rooney central again, though the left awaits for the foreseeable future, even if that combination with the No9 for the first half goal â with its input from Sterling thrown in â boded well for a partnership that is still learning to gel. England will clearly prove an attacking threat for as long as they remain at this tournament. The worry is whether their defence can cope well enough to make that relevant.
