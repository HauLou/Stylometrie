an ugly goalless draw. Instinct was to feel satisfied at a point gained on the road given the relegation scrap this campaign has become. Enter Alan Pardew, however, and the bar was immediately raised.
âIt was the first time weâd met him since the appointment and we were all sitting there thinking it was a good draw, but he came in and just said: âWell done lads, a decent point, but you need to be winning games like that,ââ says McArthur, recalling the hush which descended as the new manager set out his stall. âHe told us we had to be doing more, working harder, taking more risks. It really impressed me and itâs kicked everyone on. Performances had been good, but it was suddenly obvious itâs not acceptable to be going out and getting the odd win or draw, here and there. He is ambitious. We needed a philosophy and to be a wee bit more expansive in games. Heâs brought that to us already.â
McArthur is only five months, and three managers, into his Palace career but he is a player thriving in a team restored to an upward trajectory. They are unbeaten since Boxing Day and unrecognisable from the side whose results had rather stagnated over Neil Warnockâs brief tenure, curtailed after that last loss to Southampton. There are new players, Jordon Mutch and Shola Ameobi mingling among their new team-mates out on the training pitches, and the long negotiated takeover by the American businessman, Josh Harris, is apparently nearing a conclusion. And then there is Pardew, the manager who was unloved by most at Newcastle but is cherished by all back home. Selhurst Park will be ferociously upbeat for the visit of Everton on Saturday when his team attempt to register a fifth successive win in all competitions.
Players whose confidence had inevitably been choked over a run of one win in 14 games are liberated, with all of those offered a chance to impress â whether in FA Cup or Premier League â having seized their opportunity. What once felt a paper-thin squad suddenly boasts options. The defence is well drilled, the attack suddenly flamboyant. The industry in the centre benefits both. âWe were playing OK under the previous manager, but it was about finding a way to turn those draws and losses into wins and draws, and heâs found a way of kicking us on,â says McArthur, his flow briefly interrupted by Jason Puncheon poking his head around the kit-room door to poke fun at the flow of compliments. There is a new boss to impress.
âHeâs come from a massive club and heâs brought that feeling with him. Heâs an established Premier League manager who wants us playing more football, putting balls in the box and shooting. Itâs obviously great heâs come here. He sees that we can stay up and do well.
âWe suit the way he wants us to play and itâs started well. Thereâll be times in a season when weâre not on a good run, but the manager has the experience and know-how to turn it round. Look at the job he did at Newcastle where he was under a lot of pressure but then had, what, six wins on the bounce? That shows you the character of the manager. I felt he dealt really well with the situation up there. A lot of managers can crumble, start changing the way they do things, but he stuck with what he knew. They were in a sticky patch at the start of the season, but to go and get six wins, and against big clubs as well â¦ heâs done a great job there. Look at them now. I think theyâre missing him a wee bit.â
McArthur, at 27, already speaks like an elder statesman. He is a Scotland international and an FA Cup winner from his time at Wigan, a classy passer and energetic box-to-box player, and has arguably been Palaceâs most consistent performer over the last few months. The basis of his success was established back in Lanarkshire as a poster boy for the success of Hamilton Academicalâs youth academy. He and James McCarthy, whom he will confront at Selhurst Park on Saturday if the Irishmanâs suspect hamstring has healed, graduated there before moving on to Wigan in deals worth £500,000 and £1.2m respectively. The shrewd sell-on clauses inserted into those deals ensured Hamilton benefited significantly from the pairâs subsequent moves, to Palace and Everton, for £7m and £13m.
Others will follow their lead from the Scottish Premiership club, with Stephen Hendrie to join West Ham in the summer and the progress of Ziggy Gordon and Ali Crawford well scouted. When the newly promoted side, then under Alex Neilâs stewardship, secured a first win at Celtic Park in 76 years back in October and briefly topped the Premiership, they included eight players who had risen through their ranks. Even now they sit a fine fifth in the table.Playing 192 senior games by the age of 22 steeled McArthur, his education conducted in the Hamilton first- team rather than among the second-string at a bigger club.
âYou only get so much from reserve-team football,â he says. âIf you lose, you just shrug your shoulders, say youâre âguttedâ and forget about it. But when youâre going out there in a senior match to help your team-mates, playing for your career, for their careers, for win bonuses, for points â¦ your life is on the line, your career is on the line.
âIâd always recommend going to a smaller club to get games. If myself and James McCarthy had been at Rangers or Celtic growing up I donât think weâd have got to where we are right now. Thatâs due to being given a chance playing under pressure at a young age. Thatâs what allows players to realise their full potential.
âJames and I are still good mates. We won the FA Cup together â what an unbelievable day that was, for a club like Wigan and players like us to win the Cup â and have great memories of our times there and at The reality is Palace, too, are currently depleted. The captain, Mile Jedinak, and the campaignâs most eye-catching performer to date, Yannick Bolasie, are still absent at the Asia Cup and Africa Cup of Nations respectively, which makes the recent burst of form all the more remarkable. âThat shows you the strength of quality within the squad,â adds McArthur. âMile is a leader, a great presence, a very good footballer â¦ and Yannick has been the star performer of the season. Heâs been unbelievable, unplayable.â Do his team-mates know what the DR Congo winger is going to conjure in possession? âNo. But he does. I know thereâs been talk about him not knowing, but he knows. Heâs a brilliant footballer. Heâs raw, but he uses that to his advantage: heâs so powerful, so strong, so direct. As a full-back, thatâs the last thing you want, someone running at you that fast. Someone special to have in your side.
âBut, as the manager has stressed to us, this is about being a group, not about being individuals. Everyone has top quality in the Premier League and you canât just rely on one or two to shine. Obviously you need people to produce certain bits of magic to win matches, but we are going to get there as a team. That changing room is a good place to be.
âThe team has character. It did even when we werenât doing so well. In this league, where you know youâll be up against it some days, itâs about staying positive, keeping your heads high and believing things will turn for you. Like they have now. But thereâll be plenty of times ahead when weâll need to stick together again. We want to stay in the Premier League by fighting for each other, staying the tight unit we are. We want to prove we are good enough to be here.â
