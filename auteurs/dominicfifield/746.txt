Fernando Torres will miss Chelsea's The Spain international had felt discomfort in the leg during training on Monday and was absent on Tuesday, as José Mourinho put a party of 25 through their paces at Cobham in preparation for the Group E fixture. Torres was undergoing physiotherapy in one of the treatment rooms, along with the team's long-term injury absentee Marco van Ginkel. He will continue to be monitored this week as the club await the results of a scan.
Mourinho also revealed that the defender Ryan Bertrand picked up an injury in training on Tuesday.
"Bertrand is injured, just today in training, so I cannot say what â¦ but he's out of selection," he said. "Fernando has a muscular injury. We don't know the dimension but we await the scans tomorrow, but tomorrow out, and out for the weekend too. After that comes an international break. Let's see if he can recover after that."
Samuel Eto'o, who came off the bench in the loss at Newcastle at the weekend, is expected to start against the Germans as "They want to play. They are waiting for opportunities to play," he added. "So when they have that chance, and they know they are going to have it in this game and the next game against West Brom. They know it's in their hands, the job to play up front. I think it has to be a good motivation for them. Hopefully they can express on the pitch the way they work during the week."
The manager will consider making other changes given the disappointing nature of Saturday's defeat, with Gary Cahill likely to be recalled at centre-half.
Mourinho included the 20-year-old Nigeria international centre-back Kenneth Omeruo in the squad who trained at Cobham, along with the ineligible Michael Essien and Hilário. The Czech Tomas Kalas, another young centre-back, was also included.
