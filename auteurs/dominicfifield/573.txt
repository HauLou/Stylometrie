That was all delivered through a toothy grin, the man whose last touch for There will be a presentation on the pitch pre-match yet former team-mates, as well as the manager who made him, must now accept Drogba as nothing more than a considerable threat. This tie remains awkwardly on edge, for all that Chelsea appeared so comfortable through the opening period in Istanbul and claimed a critical away goal, and Drogba, even at the twilight stage of a glittering career, has an adrenalin-fuelled incentive to make his mark. This will not be the cowed forward who was so diminished at the Stade Vélodrome in December 2010 before that dead rubber against "Of course there will be emotions. Like the first leg when I saw my ex-team-mates, and the Chelsea fans at the stadium. It was special. But then there was the game and the game was tough with high intensity. This will be the same. If I score, with all the respect I have for this club, for the fans and the players, I might not celebrate. But if we win, I will be happy."
Did he feel a need to remind people here of his continued worth almost two years after his departure under freedom of contract? "No, not that way. I've nothing to prove to this club. Everything I have to prove I did already with Chelsea. No, I come here with another team and I just want to win the game and qualify. There's nothing personal against Chelsea. There will never be."
Mourinho would empathise with that. It is four years since he, too, returned to this corner of south-west London â then as manager of Internazionale â to oversee the elimination of his former employers from this competition. The manager had thrilled at the pre-match circus on that occasion, revelling in the limelight afforded him, but had been coldly professional enough on the night to separate himself from the theatre of it all. The Inter he sent out to defeat Carlo Ancelotti's Chelsea were expertly drilled, aware of the weaknesses they would encounter in their hosts. Even the playful chants directed at the Portuguese from the local support went ignored until the job was done.
Drogba, too, will feel he can exploit frailties in the home defence. "Didier will have probably one of the best moments in his career when he goes on to the pitch, and maybe he can't [control his emotions] for a couple of minutes then," said Mourinho. "But, after that, players, managers â¦ we can all do it. We can clean it from our minds and focus on the game. He is still top-quality, and we know he is in good form. Is he the same player at 36 that he was at 26? Nobody is. But he's one of the best strikers in the world, that's for sure. He doesn't look his age. He is good, strong."
He is also missed. That final in Munich had seemed like the perfect cut-off for both parties to go their separate ways but there have been times since â not least at Villa Park on Saturday â when Chelsea have cried out for a battering ram of a player such as Drogba, even if only to fling on late from the bench in tight contests.
Some might suggest they have one, in Romelu Lukaku, though Mourinho's insistence that the club were well aware that the older man's contract is ticking down in Turkey was intriguing. "It has to happen one day," he said. "As a player, as a coach, as an ambassador, next year, in four or five years, or 10 years, I don't know. But when a person represents so much to a club and the club represents so much to a person, as is the case, I think he has to be welcomed back."
Samuel Eto'o is expected to start against the Turkish club, the Cameroonian trotting on to the training pitch at Cobham on Monday joking loudly with Mikel John Obi, Demba Ba and Eden Hazard about being "the Daddy". Eto'o has had his moments since his move from Anzhi Makhachkala last summer but, particularly before this second leg, that moniker still feels more appropriately applied to Drogba. This will be a welcome return. Chelsea must ensure it falls short of being a glorious one.
