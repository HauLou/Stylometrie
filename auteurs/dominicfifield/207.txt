West Ham Unitedâs resurgent form this term has emboldened The teamâs predicament a year ago, when they languished second bottom of the Premier League with a hefty injury list and a two-leg League Cup semi-final against Manchester City still to come, had prompted Allardyce to make nine changes, switch formation and hand three youngsters their senior debuts for West Hamâs The Hammers were duly humiliated 5-0 at the City Ground, with 3,000 travelling fans calling for the manager to be sacked, with the priority clear to retain top-flight status. Yet a stronger squad â bolstered by the arrival of Enner Valencia, Alex Song, Morgan Amalfitano, Aaron Cresswell, Carl Jenkinson, Cheikhou Kouyaté and Diafra Sakho, who have all contributed heavily â has flourished this term and Sundayâs 3-0 victory over West Bromwich Albion left them seventh and only four points from the Champions League places with an away FA Cup tie against League One opponents, âIt was important to get back to winning ways because we hadnât won in four matches in the Premier League,â said Allardyce. âIt gives us a great opportunity to focus on Bristol City [in the fourth round of the FA Cup], make sure we get through to fifth round. That is very important to us because our position in the league is very secure. We donât have to consider resting players with one eye on Premier League results.
âWeâve come through the hardest period of all, Christmas and the new year, with games every three or four days, and are steering clear of injuries well. That gives us a chance to go forward in both the Premier League and the FA Cup.â
Bristol City have enjoyed a fine first half to their own season, and are currently second in League One behind Swindon only on difference, but will face a West Ham side who are also unbeaten to date this year. Allardyce puts the improvement this time round â his team have twice as many points as they did at the same stage last year â down to the key additions made to the squad in the summer window.
âThereâs one thing you will realise: recruitment is everything in the world of football,â he added. âYou recruit well, you become a great manager. Better players do better things, take things on board quicker, get better results. Our recruitment this year has been fantastic. To have so many players make such a difference in one seasonâs recruitment is the best Iâve ever had in my entire career.â
