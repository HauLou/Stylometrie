Loïc Rémy is to seek assurances over the role he will enjoy in the Chelsea set-up next season amid fears the imminent arrival of Radamel Falcao at Stamford Bridge will further limit the France internationalâs playing time before Euro 2016.
The striker joined from Queens Park Rangers last September, a move which allowed Chelsea to lend Fernando Torres to Milan, but ended up third-choice behind Diego Costa and Didier Drogba.
The Ivorianâs departure under freedom of contract this summer had appeared to open the door to greater involvement for Rémy next term, only for José Mourinhoâs desire to sign Falcao on loan from Monaco â a deal is likely to be confirmed once 
There is interest in Rémy from clubs in the Premier League and Ligue 1, though it remains to be seen how much Mourinhoâs instinct would be to retain his services given he contributed seven goals last term from only six league starts, including critical winners against Hull and Stoke in the spring, but he has previously made clear he will not retain players who are unsettled and desire to leave.
While West Ham have recently considered the striker, Crystal Palace would explore the possibility of reuniting Rémy with Alan Pardew, under whom he scored 14 goals in 26 Premier League appearances while on loan at Newcastle from Queens Park Rangers in 2013-14.
Palace finished 10th last term and hope to add two or three eye-catching, established talents to their squad ahead of the new season â they have spoken to Paris Saint-Germain about another former Newcastle player, the midfielder Yohan Cabaye â and would be prepared to offer the striker, who earns around £80,000 a week at present, a competitive wage.
Whether they could meet the size of fee required to prise Rémy away, however, remains to be seen. Chelsea will seek to make a profit on a player who is also interesting his hometown club Lyon, recently qualified for the Champions League and through whose youth academy he graduated before moving to Nice in 2008.
The Premier League champions could even explore the possibility of recruiting Lyonâs highly-rated France Under-21 international defender Samuel Umtiti as part of a possible deal. Umtiti, who was born in Cameroon, can play at centre-half or left-back and is of interest with Filipe Luís expected to leave Stamford Bridge for a return to Atlético Madrid this summer.
Rémy will seek to ascertain what role has been earmarked for him next season with the Premier League champions before determining his next move, but is keen to gain regular game-time to ensure he plays a part in Didier Deschampsâ France squad at Euro 2016.
Chelsea could potentially follow up Falcaoâs arrival on a 12-month loan with a move for Antoine Griezmann from Atlético â the Frenchman has a £43m buyout clause in his contract â which would see them beginning the defence of their title with a revamped forward line.
