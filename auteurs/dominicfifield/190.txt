Crystal Palace completed a frantic month by securing Wilfried Zaha and Lee Chung-yong from Zaha, who had spent the first half of the season on loan at Selhurst Park, rejoined Palace having failed to make an impact at United in the two years since signing for Sir Alex Ferguson for an initial £10m.
The 22-year-old made only four appearances under David Moyes last season, and did not start a âI wasnât getting much game time at Manchester United so took the opportunity of coming back on loan this season,â Zaha said. âTo now have the chance to make the move permanent and come home to Selhurst Park is something Iâm delighted about.
âFor me to be a better player I need to play more games and having a gaffer I know has great trust in me gives me the confidence I need to help me improve my game. I started playing here when I was eight years of age and my family live local and to have the opportunity to take the field in the Premier League for this club is a dream come true.â
Lee passed a medical at Palaceâs training ground despite the 26-year-old suffering from a hairline fracture of his shin, which will keep him out for another four weeks, but was secured for around £750,000 on a deal until 2018.
The South Korea international was out of contract at Bolton in the summer â Barry Bannan moved on loan in the opposite direction â and joins Yaya Sanogo, Jordon Mutch, Shola Ameobi and Pape Souaré in linking up with Alan Pardewâs side in the window.
Palace have also secured Keshi Anderson from non-league Barton Rovers for £35,000 and Andreas Breimyr from the Norwegian club Bryne, who will retain him for the remainder of this season, with both expected to join the development squad.
