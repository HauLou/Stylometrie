Stéphane Mbia is hoping his encouraging form for Mbia, who made 29 Premier League starts for The 27-year-old has effectively replaced Gary Medel in central midfield, since his own summer move to Cardiff, as part of a radical overhaul of the Spanish club's squad which saw around £80m of talent shipped out and £30m reinvested on new personnel.
There was, perhaps inevitably, a slow start to the new campaign as players familiarised themselves with each other, but an unbeaten recent run has hoisted Sevilla into the top half. They are currently seven points adrift of fourth-place Villarreal.
"I'm pleased with the way things are going here in Spain," said Mbia, who had injured a knee in last month's victory over Rayo Vallecano. "I'm enjoying my football and am influencing games for Sevilla, playing my part in the team. This has been a good move for me and I'm looking forward to helping the club progress in the Europa League and "At the end of the season I will see where my future lies, but I hope I will have done enough to earn myself a place at a club in the Champions League, whether that is here in Sevilla or elsewhere."
The Cameroonian had joined QPR from Marseille for £4m in the summer of 2012 and signed a two-year deal with an option for a third. He was a regular selection in midfield under Harry Redknapp but was allowed to leave in August having expressed frustration at the prospect of life in the Championship.
It remains to be seen whether the London club, who are currently third in the second tier, would seek to hold him to that extra season, with the situation to be addressed formally upon the conclusion of his loan deal in Spain. Yet while an extension of his stay in west London appears unlikely, Mbia still aspires to make his mark in the Premier League.
