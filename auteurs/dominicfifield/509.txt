Wojciech Szczesny has voiced frustration at Arsenal's inability to sustain a title challenge this season but he believes the squad will gain from their experience and, if further additions are made, will pose a greater threat next term.
Arsène Wenger's side can claim their first trophy in nine years if they overcome Hull City in the FA Cup final on Saturday 17 May, though the fact their challenge for the The prospect of a 17th successive season of Champions League football provides a considerable consolation but there is a sense of what might have been. "With two games to go we had nothing to play for and we shouldn't really be in that position," said Szczesny in the wake of Sunday's home victory against West Bromwich Albion. "We should be fighting for the title. I believe we should be in a position to challenge to win the Premier League. But we dropped some important points and lost games and had a new challenge, to finish fourth when we weren't probably the favourites to do that. At least we managed to do that for our fans and hopefully we'll manage to get the FA Cup for them.
"I never considered fourth place before the start of the season as a successful season and a good position. I play for Szczesny pointed to untimely injuries suffered by Aaron Ramsey â who had enjoyed his most productive form for the club until being ruled out from Boxing Day through to April â and Mesut Özil as having checked the team's progress. "Obviously it made a difference," he said. "You could see when Mesut and Aaron came back recently we started winning games and we looked a completely different team. We've had a bit of bad luck but I believe we had a squad strong enough to challenge anyway.
"We have improved, so that's one thing we have learned. The squad is stronger and everyone can say the squad was strong enough to challenge for the title. It didn't happen for us this year but one thing we have learned is that we are good enough to challenge next year, and hopefully add a little bit more strength as well with a couple of new players coming in. Hopefully we will be stronger and, if we manage to keep the consistency for the whole season, we'll be up there."
The Poland goalkeeper, who is established as Arsenal's first choice, still hopes to feature in the showpiece at Wembley against Hull despite his compatriot, Lukasz Fabianski, having been the team's regular in the FA Cup this season. "I speak with Lukasz but I haven't spoken to the boss about it," said Szczesny. "There's no banter [with Lukasz]. Look, we're both professional and we would both love to play in the Cup final.
"It's the boss's decision to make, not an easy one, because there is a No1 at the club and a goalkeeper who is the reason we are in the FA Cup final. I think Lukasz has done so well that he deserves to play but, having said that, I'm a professional and I would love to play in the Cup final."
