Ars√®ne Wenger has called for calm after watching Chelsea's collection of expensive fringe players prevailed comfortably here against a much-changed home lineup to progress to the Asked whether the loss had cast doubts over Arsenal's strength in depth in comparison with that of the visitors, Wenger said: "Let's not go too quick to conclusions. If you take the points we have made since 1 January, it's more than anyone else. On a longer distance, you'll see more of the quality of the team than in the last two games. It's difficult to swallow what happened to us in the last week, but the mistakes we have made are so big that they can be corrected. We have to keep the basis of our game and go into the next one.
"In football it's always difficult to be definite. People go quickly to definite conclusions. After the first game [loss] against Aston Villa we were relegated. Today we are in a strong position in the league. Do not draw conclusions too quickly. We have [Theo] Walcott, [Lukas] Podolski and [Alex] Oxlade-Chamberlain out, players who have a big impact offensively. If you put them in, it's a completely different type of team. But it's now about how we rid ourselves of these mistakes without losing the belief in our qualities. That is what is at stake."

Away from home we are very solid, but at home you know it's important and vital to win the big games."
