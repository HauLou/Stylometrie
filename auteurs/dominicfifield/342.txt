This is a start, the moment things clicked, youngsters grew up on this stage and the team began rekindling the nationâs enthusiasm for all things In inflicting Switzerlandâs first home defeat in 10 matches and establishing an early grip on Group E Hodgsonâs side have justified all the optimism preached by the management over the last few weeks. There really is promise. There can be progression. By discomforting and defeating the side ranked ninth in the world they have even shown they are capable of adapting their approach. Basel must become the benchmark.
That Hodgson has convinced himself this team need not develop within the tactical restraints of a 4-4-2 may also prove significant. It was only in the build-up to the Norway friendly last week that he had suggested he was all for the tried and tested. âI donât get hung up as to whether itâs the buzz formation of the moment,â he had said. âItâs about whether itâs the best formation for these players.â
The stodge that ensued perhaps suggested they were better suited to a more fluid approach. For around 20 minutes at the end of that game, with Wayne Rooney substituted and Welbeck paired with Daniel Sturridge up front, the management had experimented with their best performer in his most threatening free role. When Sterling is in this form, it is sometimes better to be en vogue.
There was risk in adopting the diamond formation for the most daunting match in the section. The quartet who started in Englandâs midfield had 45 caps between them before the match while the Swiss trio â Valon Behrami, Gokhan Inler and Granit Xhaka â had a combined 159. Experience was weighted with the locals.
Yet this was the management seeking to eke the best from their most exhilarating performer. Sterling had thrilled at White Hart Lane a few days before that Norway win as Liverpool left Spurs dazed by the speed of their attacks and the aggression of their movement, the teenager scything through the hosts at will. Replicate that tempo and he could dazzle again.
The sight of England players swarming over their opponents set the tone, the harrying and hassling stemming from Fabian Delphâs first few touches on his first start â admittedly not all legal but, having escaped an early expulsion, he impressed in possession â and Jordan Hendersonâs dynamism. The fact that Gökhan Inler was jolted into a mistake in the build-up to the opening goal was proof the tactic was not merely whipped up in the opening exchanges. With his team so feverishly driven, the 19-year-old at the tip of midfield could revel.
From the centre Sterling could scuttle at Steve von Bergen or isolate Johan Djourou, veer into the space in front of Ricardo Rodríguez or Stephan Lichtsteiner as team-mates replicated his gallop. Both full-backs were becalmed in the face of English urgency.
Von Bergen was scorched early. His sloppy pass was intercepted 15 minutes in with the teenager darting forward and the centre-half utterly panicked. There was Swiss relief when the youngster chose to pass rather than shoot and Rooneyâs attempt could be choked.
That was a reminder this talent is still developing but the whole set-up was a vote of confidence in Sterlingâs innate ability. This is a player around whom this team already revolve, a threat who attracts markers and allows others across the front line to flourish. Welbeckâs double, his first international goals in over a year with his confidence perhaps boosted by his £16m move to Arsenal and the promise of greater involvement to come, caught the eye but this victory was fuelled by Sterlingâs pace. The Swiss never really contained the teenager. He was unpredictable, uncatchable once in full flow and utterly irrepressible throughout.
England can lean on him already but they will hope that talent develops further in the Champions League with Liverpool.
He was not alone in impressing, with John Stones assured at right-back, Rooney exerting positive influence, Joe Hart conjuring two timely saves and Gary Cahill rising to the challenge when leadership was required across the back line.
Then there was Jack Wilshere, tucked in at the base of the diamond in a role he is still learning. He has played deep before but rarely alone. In 2010-11, when he enjoyed arguably his best season with Arsenal, he had mainly been paired with Alex Song, responsibilities shared.
Arsène Wenger had toyed with the idea of playing the 22-year-old in the deepest berth in pre-season this summer, experimenting regularly in training sessions. It may be where he ultimately ends up but for now the suspicion is that there is far too much forward-thinking energy to his approach. And, after all, tackling is not his forte.
With England he had generally been flanked by experience, a Frank Lampard or Steven Gerrard and sometimes both. Yet here he was anchoring, his job to intercept and spark passing moves upfield. The role offered him that opportunity with his passing neat and his concentration fixed. The exchanges he generated forced him upfield, and he had been integral to another slick move that culminated with Henderson centring and Sterling air-kicking. The role can seem unspectacular at times but it is crucial if the diamond is to flourish. This was another relative novice learning on the job and offering hope.
Watching them thrive will exorcise memories of the World Cup soon enough. Hodgson has his respite.
