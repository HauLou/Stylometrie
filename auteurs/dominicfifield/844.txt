Stéphane Mbia is set to become the latest high-profile departure from Queens Park Rangers as they adjust to life in the Championship after the Cameroonian midfielder was told he could leave Loftus Road before the closure of the transfer window next month.
Mbia, who moved to the west London club from Marseille a year ago on a two-year contract, has yet to feature in Harry Redknapp's side in the second tier this season and has been told to find a new club. The 27-year-old, who is not represented by an agent with his lawyer working on his behalf, has attracted tentative interest from Sevilla and Besiktas abroad but would prefer to remain in England, having featured 29 times in the Premier League last term as The utility player had previously been targeted by Everton while establishing his reputation with Rennes â he had cost Marseille an eye-catching £10.4m when moving to Stade Velodrome four years ago â and Fulham and West Ham United considered offers this summer. QPR are expected to waive a fee for a player who has entered the final 12 months of his deal at the club, as they seek to remove his salary from the books.
Redknapp has already succeeded in off-loading Christopher Samba, Djibril Cissé, José Bosingwa, Loïc Rémy, Esteban Granero and Park Ji-sung either permanently or on long-term loan deals, allowing him some leeway in the market to construct a team he believes will be capable of returning to the elite at the first attempt.
