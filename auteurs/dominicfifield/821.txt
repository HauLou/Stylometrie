Zinedine Zidane didn't have his most fantastic game against us in Euro 2004 [above], but the presence of the man on the pitch was amazing. An absolute Rolls Royce of a player

For talent and ability Wayne Rooney, certainly in terms of his technical awareness and receiving the ball

I remember the Croatia game under Fabio Capello as a great night [5-1 in September 2009, above]. Everything came together and, on certain nights at Wembley, that can happen. I also loved playing against Brazil at the Maracanã in the summer: a great occasion and we gave a good account of ourselves. I remember beating Argentina in a friendly in Geneva when Michael Owen scored late on, which was against a really fancied team

My first goal against Croatia in August 2003 [above] because I remember the feeling: it was actually a good strike. Then against France at Euro 2004, the header, my first tournament goal. Then I'd go for a goal I scored against Poland at Old Trafford, a volley just after we'd qualified for the World Cup in 2006

You have your difficult moments in games. I tell you one which was horrible: when we played Spain in Seville and lost 2-0 [in February 2009, above]. They just passed us off the park with Xavi and Iniesta in midfield. Sometimes you have to hold your hands up. It doesn't make you a bad man to say they were too good that day. We got our own back a few years later at Wembley â¦ not by playing them off the park, admittedly, but we still got a win against them, the world champions
