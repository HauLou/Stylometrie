âIâd only ever been to St Georgeâs Park with West Ham, and never with the England set-up,â he says, shrugging off the after-effects of his first training session with the national team in over two years. âWhen I was picked before weâd always be at the Grove in Watford or the Lowry in Manchester. Iâm still finding my way around this place. I probably feel more nervous turning up for this than I did coming in for my debut, given itâs a new set-up and Iâve been out for so long. My time looked as if it had gone. But youâve just got to keep playing well and knocking on the door and this proves why. Iâm over the moon to be here.â
Downingâs recall to the squad for Saturdayâs qualifier against The 30-year-old has played for his country during spells at three clubs â West Ham would be a fourth â and under a quartet of permanent managers, his 34 caps encompassing only 668 minutes of competitive football and all played from a starting position on the flank. He returns with his club form revived in a free berth behind a pair of energetic strikers, a No10 role he had enjoyed once or twice for Gareth Southgate at Middlesbrough but in which he is revelling under Sam Allardyce.
The only confusion is that England are well stocked in that area, with Raheem Sterling, Wayne Rooney and Ross Barkley all vying to be a central playmaker. Two of those represent the long-term future, young players the like of whom even Downing had considered the managementâs clear priority, and the other is Roy Hodgsonâs captain and so, effectively, untouchable. For a player whose last game for his country was the current head coachâs first, in Norway just before Euro 2012 when he was an £18m Liverpool midfielder struggling to justify that weighty fee, his time appeared to be up.
âIâd played in that first game, then gone to the Euros and not featured and after that I wasnât picked at all,â says Downing. âI thought heâd go in a new direction and with a new type of player, maybe the younger guys youâve seen coming into the squad. I had no problem with that. My form at the time probably wasnât good enough to be in, to be honest. It hurts but I had bigger things to deal with back then. I wasnât in the team at Liverpool, I was in and out and having a difficult spell there and that was the biggest challenge for me at the time.
âI even had a few games at left-back, not somewhere I was happy and not my natural position. I knew from then it was time for me to move. I was getting signals other players were coming in and I was getting used at left-back when I was a winger. You know when the writing is on the wall for you under a manager. Liverpool is a great club and not many people walk out of there easily but I had discussions [with Brendan Rodgers] and got the message it was going to be difficult for me to play every week. At my age I needed to go out and play.
âSam came calling, they agreed a fee pretty quickly and it was all done and dusted. The manager [Rodgers] said he didnât want me to leave but, if a feeâs agreed, Iâm sure everyone had agreed I should go. Sam made an effort, the way he spoke to me and how he saw me playing in his team. Heâs a good man to play for and heâs been true to his word since Iâve been there. It was a chance to go out and play football regularly under a manager who wanted me.â
His recall should actually be considered a triumph of reinvention. While last year was arguably one of adjustment in a West Ham team that struggled for consistency, his displays to date this season in a side reinvigorated by shrewd business in the summer have demanded attention, from the well-taken goals at Crystal Palace and Stoke to the creativity, pace and movement he has offered from the middle.
Hodgson had twice ventured to see Allardyce after recent games and spoke to Downing on each occasion, little reminders his impact was being noted. âWingers tend to move inside as they get older,â he says. âRyan Giggs did it. [Allardyce] has seen something in my game and thought I could play there. He wants me to get on the ball more and counterattack teams.â Given his impact to date, being cast once more to the flank with the England set-up would actually seem a retrograde step.
That is where Kenny Dalglish and, initially, Allardyce had seen his role, given the lumbering presence of Andy Carroll as the focal point of their respective teamsâ frontline. The plan was simple: Downing was supposed to cross for the 6ft 4in forward to convert. He was the supply line. These days his re-emergence may prove an inspiration for a club-mate whose own career has been so badly affected by injury.
âRoy is a big admirer of Andyâs and, when heâs been fit, heâs picked him,â Downing says. âFor Andy the most important thing is getting through the next seven weeksâ training and games. He came back last time and broke down but heâs itching to play. We need him back fit as we need that competition for goals. Heâs a different option for us â on Saturday he came on [against Aston Villa in stoppage time] and flattened someone straight away, then had two efforts saved by [Brad] Guzan.
âI know he loves playing for his country. As do I. The atmosphere feels very relaxed. These lads have played at their clubs together and you can see theyâre all in with each other. Theyâre building a team with young lads who are all willing to learn. Give them a couple of years and, by 2016, the manager will know what theyâre all about. Thatâs the time to judge this side.â
Whether or not Downing is involved in France, he is pinching himself for now just to be back in contention.
