José Mourinho has confirmed Chelsea will offer âThere are no doubts that he is going to get another contract,â said Mourinho. âI know that, he knows that. We in the club, in the board, we all know that and I think, also, you have to feel that. Without us confirming anything you have to feel that. Heâs a very important player in the team so the next contract, sooner or later, will come. Itâs a formality.â
Terry, who was outstanding playing his 645th game for the Premier League leaders in the 2-0 Boxing Day success over West Ham, had signed a one-year deal last summer; Chelsea have adopted a policy of offering only 12-month contract extensions to players in their 30s.
Yet the captain, who turned 34 at the start of this month, is an ever-present in the Premier League so far this season with Mourinhoâs medical staff, in conjunction with the coaches, having devised specific training regimes to offer him the best opportunity to play regularly. Indeed, the defender was one of three players granted a three-day break from the club earlier this month to provide a breather.
The centre-halfâs elite career had appeared to be drawing to a close when back and knee injuries restricted him to only 16 appearances over the six-month interim stewardship of Rafael Benítez, but he played in all but four of Chelseaâs league games last season and has maintained that eye-catching form this time round.
âHeâs a happy guy, heâs playing well, he likes his team-mates, he likes the manager and he is working well,â said Mourinho, who has spoken often of his achievement in restoring the playerâs âself-esteemâ after those injuries prompted self-doubt in previous years. âItâs a very happy group and I think John feels very, very well.â
The 23-year-old playmaker was excellent against West Ham, maintaining his own eye-catching form, and Mourinho is eager to tap into Hazardâs enthusiasm. âYou see the way he plays: heâs a happy guy out on the pitch, he doesnât feel the pressure, he doesnât feel responsibility, he just wants to enjoy it,â said the Portuguese, who had sought to drum into Hazard the need to work harder defensively for the team last season.
âHe plays in the first minute like he plays in minute 90. It doesnât matter the result â fantastic, no pressure â and thatâs a good feeling for me. Credit for him [for reacting to last seasonâs criticisms].
âHe didnât lose his spontaneity, he didnât lose his happiness, he didnât lose his creativity, none of his good qualities, but he won some other qualities. Even physically look at him, heâs a small guy but heâs very strong. He scored with his head [against Hull earlier this month], jumps well, heâs strong to hold off contact from opponents. We are doing all that progressively. We didnât try to bring that out of him by flicking a switch. Itâs progressive and great evolution.â
Chelsea, who have won all five of their fixtures in all competitions since losing for the only time to date this term, a 2-1 defeat at Newcastle on 6 December, do not anticipate any incoming transfers in January.
Likewise, having sold Juan Mata and David Luiz for £37.1m and £50m respectively in the past two windows with financial fair play in mind, they will resist any high-profile departures from the squad.
âI donât think [there will be any],â added Mourinho. âMata was a fantastic deal for the club. We couldnât stop a fantastic deal for a club like ours that looks to numbers and must care about numbers, so it was an amazing number for us, so we had to do it.
âAt that time we were just thinking about numbers. If heâd stayed in our team, our team would have been good and he would have been a valuable player and an important player for us. It was so important for us, but it allowed us to do other things. Like David [Luiz], a valuable player but amazing number, so good.â
