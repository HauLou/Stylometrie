Queens Park Rangersâ long-anticipated relegation at least brought an attempt at a show of positivity. Chris Ramsey spoke of the clubâs âgood ownersâ and, in the director of football Les Ferdinand, a figure intent upon implementing some much-needed long-term planning. Those senior players willing to reflect suggested the head coach should be made a permanent appointment, with the general tone an acknowledgement that demotion will at least provide an opportunity to cleanse.
There was even defiance of sorts. Confirmation filtered through mid-afternoon on Monday that legal proceedings are âongoingâ with the Football League, under whose umbrella they will play again next season, to challenge the governing bodyâs financial fair play rules. This campaign has been played out in the ominous shadow of a potential £58m fine which would greet them on a return to the Championship. The club are confident they will avoid that level of sanction, though they have left themselves open to accusations of fighting with far more commitment in the courts than they did out on the field.
In truth, it is hard to put a positive spin on another campaign which has, too often, merely offered up that familiar blend of chaos and confusion which had accompanied Rangersâ last two-year spell in the top flight. For all Joey Bartonâs talk of âbad eggsâ in the dressing room, and the teamâs spluttering displays out on the pitch, a sense of perspective is still required.
The chairman, Tony Fernandes, is also the face of AirAsia and has endured the aftermath of the tragedy of flight QZ8501, which crashed on 28 December between Surabaya and Singapore with the death of all 162 people on board. He has attended funerals of the victims and dealt regularly with their families. In that context, relegation means little.
Yet this summer the focus will be on what happens next at QPR. This is a club in a state of flux. The chief executive, Philip Beard, will depart at the end of the season with a replacement still to be appointed. Ramsey, the man to whom Rangers eventually turned to when Harry Redknapp resigned 24 hours after the closure of the transfer window, will be granted the managerial role on a full-time basis. Results may have been indifferent to date â QPR have not won at home since just before Christmas, and their away record is the worst in the division â but the 53-year-old is in situ, eager to work with youngsters, and respected in the set-up.
âIt was a hard job for him to help us stay up, and heâs been unlucky too,â said Leroy Fer. âBut he knows what this club is all about. I hope he stays, makes us a better team and gets us back up.â
That may be optimistic, not least given the extent of the revamp required. When Clint Hill spoke, following Sundayâs 6-0 drubbing at Manchester City, of âa chance to rebuild, get the culture right and allow the club to start againâ, he did so as one of 10 first-team players whose contracts expire on 30 June. There number includes seven 30-somethings, from Barton to Bobby Zamora, Rio Ferdinand to Richard Dunne. Another quartet of loanees, secured by Redknapp from Juventus, Napoli, Dynamo Kyiv and West Ham, will depart. The chance to rebuild without the financial drain of those players, many of whom have underachieved, on the books is appealing.
Yet what will be left behind? There will be suitors for Charlie Austin, who enters the final year of his deal at Loftus Road this summer and will be keen to remain a top-flight performer after the finest campaign of his career. West Bromwich Albion and Newcastle would lead the pursuit of his signature, though the striker did fail a medical at Hull in 2013 and concerns over his fitness could, potentially, affect the size of any fee. H is sale, together with that of the likes of Steven Caulker, Fer, Rob Green and Matt Phillips might generate income to offer leeway in the transfer market. Shifting others from the wage bill may be trickier. There may be few takers for Armand Traoré, Nedum Onuoha, Sandro or, perhaps most pertinently, Adel Taarabt. The Moroccan earns around £75,000-a-week and has played 295 minutes of Premier League football this season without contributing a goal. Add in his appearance in the Capital One Cup loss to Burton last August and that is virtually £10,000 per minute played. He is contracted to 2016. Even if stalwarts such as Hill are retained in a coaching capacity, the squad has long needed a purge. Les Ferdinand has been charged with revitalising a rather neglected academy, the long-term objective to provide a conveyor-belt of talent into the first-team via a proposed new training centre at Warren Farm. As it is, Ramsey will lean heavily next year on those few youngsters the set-up has produced in recent times: step forward Aaron Mitchell, Michael Doughty, Darnell Furlong, Brandon Comley, Frankie Sutherland and Reece Grego-Cox, whose time may have come. As Fulham have discovered this season, however, competing in the Championship while relying heavily upon players plucked fresh from the youth system is no guarantee of survival, let alone success. Indeed, money was spent at Craven Cottage in the wake of a clear-out, with over £10m splashed on Leedsâ Ross McCormack, and still the team only secured safety in the last few weeks of the campaign.The level of investment permitted at Loftus Road will surely only be determined by the outcome of the legal proceedings over financial fair play. Relegation will be accompanied by a £25m parachute payment, but the potential is there for that to be swallowed up by the threatened fine. The arguments with the Football League will centre upon the writing off of around £60m in loans by the owners â including £53.7m by Tune QPR, the vehicle through which Fernandes, Kamarudin Meranun and Ruben Gnanalingam own 69% of the club â over their promotion-winning season in 2013â14. The League argues such a move is not legitimate under the rules. That dispute will rumble on as the club play out their Premier League season with games against Newcastle and Leicester which retain meaning only for their opponents. Fernandes is intent upon focusing âon the futureâ, insistent in tweets that âas a group of shareholders, we remain 100% committed in the short, medium and long-termâ. That is just as well because the recovery will take time to instigate. If and when QPR revive, they will surely return in a very different guise. Changing the culture may prove a painful process.
