Despite having three years to run on his current contract the 23-year-old is understood to be keen to open negotiations over a new deal, including a pay rise to secure parity with players such as his England team-mate Theo Walcott. Wilshere would be an attractive signing for a club such as Manchester City as an association-trained talent.
Arsenal are less inclined to enter negotiations over new terms this summer, with the player making clear his immediate priority is to stay at Arsenal. âI definitely wouldnât go somewhere just because Iâm a homegrown player,â said the midfielder. âIâd want to be wanted by a club. I want to be wanted by Arsenal. Iâve grown up at Arsenal, Iâm a homegrown player and, as long as Having suffered from long-standing ankle issues, Wilshere endured another injury-interrupted campaign, demonstrating flurries of fine form for club and country but starting only nine Premier League matches. His momentum was checked by another ankle injury, sustained in a challenge by Manchester Unitedâs Paddy McNair in November, which sidelined him for almost six months, with his involvement in the FA Cup final limited to a 13-minute cameo as a replacement for Walcott.
âThere have probably been more lows then highs, although winning the FA Cup makes you realise, after all that hard work in the gym, that it was all worth it,â said Wilshere. âIt has been a frustrating season for me getting injured in November and not coming back until April. It is frustrating when you see all the players going out to training and playing in the games but I am back now and hopefully I can have a fully fit season next year.
âIâd come back from the World Cup and my ankle was fine, felt good, and then all of a sudden I got tackled [by McNair]. It wasnât a great tackle but it wasnât done on purpose. It was just one of those things. It was a pretty straightforward injury, quite common in football: just syndesmosis, with the ligaments. I just had to respect the time limit the specialist gave me and, since Iâve been back, Iâve had no problems with it; no pain. I got a cyst around it so they took the wire out but that took four weeks and I was fine. My first ankle injury had been different as a stress fracture, and the screws they put in had irritated me.
âWhen I was injured a few people said I should change my game, I should get it and pass it. It did go through my head. I thought maybe they are right and I should. But as soon as I came back and I got on the ball, I just wanted to run with it. Look at the best dribblers in the world, Lionel Messi and Andrés Iniesta, and the ball seems to stick to their foot, so I can work on that when I am dribbling. But Iâm never going to change my game.â
He will undertake his own fitness programme over the summer in the hope he can make a more prolonged impact next term. âItâs different with me,â he added. âLook at players like Santi Cazorla, who needs the rest because heâs had 55 games this season [including with Spain] and needs to go away and put his feet up. For me, I will probably have a week off and then get back to training, back to the gym, back to jogging, hitting the gym every day.â
