The Brazil-born forward, a £32m addition from Atlético Madrid, has been troubled by a hamstring complaint since arriving in the Premier League this summer and José Mourinho had suggested he should miss his adopted countryâs Euro 2016 qualifiers against Slovakia and Luxembourg to rest the thigh. However, the 26-year-old played the whole 90 minutes as Spain lost their first qualifier in eight years in Zilina last Thursday and a further 82 minutes in Sundayâs more comfortable success.
That appearance also yielded Costaâs first goal for his country, on his seventh cap, with the player reporting back to Cobham on Tuesday and due to train normally over the remainder of the week. Costa has managed nine goals already in seven Premier League appearances and will hope to maintain that record at Selhurst Park, where Chelsea surprising succumbed 1-0 back in the spring. Cesc Fàbregas also played the whole game against Slovakia, with César Azpilicueta an unused substitute for both qualifiers.
Of the 28 Chelsea players called up to represent their country, either at senior or under-21 level, André Schürrle will be monitored before the weekend fixture, having been withdrawn from Germanyâs qualifier against the Republic of Ireland on Tuesday because he was suffering from flu.
Eden Hazard, rested against Andorra, played the full 90 minutes in the draw in Bosnia, while Petr Cech featured for the Czech Republic in Kazakhstan. The experienced goalkeeper is expected to return to the bench at Palace because Thibaut Courtois has proved his full recovery from the head injury sustained against Arsenal and played both games for Belgium.
Real Madrid are understood to be considering testing Cechâs potential availability in January, given Iker Casillasâs patchy form at the Champions League holders. Cech, who has made only two club appearances to date this term, worked with Carlo Ancelotti at Stamford Bridge and while his intention had always been to fight to regain his first-team place, he will reassess that situation in January, if his opportunities remain so limited.
Whether Ramires and Didier Drogba are now back in full training after groin and ankle problems respectively.
Meanwhile, the Tottenham Hotspur and England full-back, Kyle Walker, is targeting his clubâs trip to Chelsea on 3 December for a potential return to competitive action after an abdominal injury.
The 24-year-old underwent surgery last month after the problem ruled him out of the tail end of last season and the summerâs World Cup. He hopes to resume training with the squad next month and, should he avoid any setbacks, would potentially be available for a December return.
