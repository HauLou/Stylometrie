The biggest cull of public sector jobs for at least 50 years will see vulnerable parts of the state endure reductions in headcount of up to 40%, Britain's leading tax and spending thinktank said today.
A report by the The IFS said that the government's own spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, was expecting 1.1m jobs to go in the eight years from 2010-11, of which only a quarter had so far been lost.
But the thinktank added that the decision to ringfence the budgets for the "At the extreme, if there were no reductions to the education and NHS workforces between mid-2013 and 2018â19, the OBR's forecasts could only be borne out if the rest of the general government workforce were to shrink by 40% (from 2.2 to 1.3m) between mid-2013 and 2018-19," the report said.
"Even if the education and the NHS workforces were reduced by 200,000 over the next five years (a fall of 6%), the reductions in other areas of general government employment would still need to be about 30%."
The IFS said the state already employed a smaller proportion of the workforce than at any time for 40 years, and that the further headcount reductions expected by 2018 would dramatically change the nature of the UK labour market. By mid-2013, the first round of job cuts meant 19% of jobs were in the public sector, but this percentage would come down to 15% by the end of the deficit-reduction plan in 2018-19.
It added that over the past 50 years, health and education had increasingly dominated public sector employment, making up 37% of jobs in 1961, 47% in 1991 and 60% in 2013. By 2018-19, in the event that the NHS and education escape any job cuts, they would account for 70% of public sector employment.
Jonathan Cribb, Research Economist at IFS and an author of the report, said: "The public sector workforce grew by over 600,000 over the 2000s. Even so, the scale of the reductions expected over the next few years looks challenging. If delivered, the 1.1m drop in general government employment forecast by the OBR between 2010â11 and 2018â19 would be almost three times larger than the previous drop during the early 1990s.
"The workforce is a useful prism through which to look at the effects of cutting total spending whilst protecting the NHS and schools budgets from cuts. With limited falls in the health and education workforces the number of public sector workers in other areas could fall by 30-40% over the next five years."
So far, job cuts in the public sector have been more than matched by increases in private sector employment but the IFS said poorer regions of the UK were doing worse than better off parts of the country.
"The percentage of the workforce in the public sector varies across regions, from almost 28% in Wales to under 21% in London. Private sector employment has risen in each region by more than public employment has fallen between the first quarter of 2010 and the second quarter of 2013. However, regions with the largest falls in public employment are not seeing the strongest growth in private sector employment."
