The battle between Argentina and the funds that refused to participate in the restructuring of the South American country's debt matters. It clearly matters for Argentina, which at worst could be plunged into a fresh default if forced to pay. That's because the total bonds in default amount to $15bn (£8.8bn), more than 50% of the country's total foreign currency reserves. And there is a risk that those creditors that did agree to the restructuring â accounting for more than 90% of the debt â will then want the same terms as the vulture funds.
But it also matters for any other country that needs to restructure its debt if it runs into financial problems. It will become much harder for hard-pressed countries to strike deals with creditors if bondholders know they can ultimately secure much better returns by sitting tight. The IMF is concerned by the systemic implications of the Argentinian ruling â and rightly so.
What the fund should be doing is pressing members to revive the idea of an international bankruptcy court for countries. At present, a company can secure protection from creditors through insolvency but a sovereign state cannot. This would decide how much a country could afford to pay and adjudicate between different classes of creditor.
The case of Argentina shows that corporations have a stronger legal position in bankruptcy law than countries, and that the interests of investors in vulture funds count for more than those of citizens. That needs remedying â fast.
