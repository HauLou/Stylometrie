All credit to Mario Draghi. The European Central Bank caught the financial markets totally unawares when it cut its key interest rate to 0.25% and there was an instant response. The euro - perilously overvalued on the foreign exchanges - fell like a stone.
Draghi clearly had to overcome resistance from the ECB council, with some members seeking to delay any easing of policy to a later date. This would have been a mistake. The latest figures show the euro area flirting dangerously with deflation, with prices rising at an annual rate of just 0.7%. Try as he might to dispel the idea, the euro area today is starting to look worryingly like Japan in the early 1990s. Credit flows have dried up, a double dip recession has left oodles of spare capacity, and there is plenty of deflationary pressure coming down the pipeline, from the falling cost of food to lower prices for manufactured goods.
Deflation is already a reality for the troubled countries on the fringes of monetary union, with the real and present danger of the core following before too long. So Draghi was quite right to face down the Bundesbank and insist on immediate action.
The fall in the value of the euro will - if sustained - help avert the threat of deflation by increasing the cost of imports. Draghi, therefore, missed a trick when he said the value of the single currency had not been discussed at the ECB's council meeting. This was the opportunity to talk down the euro, getting the maximum out of the cut in borrowing costs.
The ECB president also invited derision by saying that the eurozone (unemployment 12.2%, trend rate of growth 1% at best, a broken banking system) had the best economic fundamentals in the world. In truth, deflation threatens to trigger a new phase of the eurozone crisis, because falling prices plus weak growth equals unsustainable debt. The ECB's action is a recognition that it has fallen way behind the curve in dealing with this threat. Further steps will be needed.
