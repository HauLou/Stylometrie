cut the cost of borrowing to 0.5% â the lowest it had been since the Bank of England was founded in 1694.
But Mark Carney and his eight colleagues have a long way to go before they can beat the period between 1932 and 1951 â which straddled the Jarrow march, the abdication of Edward VIII, the second world war and the founding of the NHS â when bank rate remained remarkably fixed.
As today, the long period of low interest rates was seen as the antidote to a deep and prolonged slump. As now, the impact was felt in the housing market, although in the 1930s cheap money led to a building boom that spawned the classic suburban semi, rather than to rising property prices.
But in the modern era, bank rate has tended to be a lot higher. The post-war peak came in late 1979, when the monetarist policies pursued by Margaret Thatcherâs government resulted in official interest rates being raised to 17%. On Black Wednesday â September 16 1992 â when George Soros and other speculators drove the UK out of the European exchange rate mechanism, the governmentâs vain rearguard action involved an increase from 10% to 12% in the morning, and in the afternoon a pledge to raise them again to 15%.
By the time Gordon Brown granted the Bank independence in 1997, bank rate, at 6.25%, was back to levels seen when the Bank was created. The ânew normalâ in what Mervyn King called the NICE decade (non-inflationary continual expansion) was for official rates to fluctuate from 7.5% at the top to 3.75% at the bottom. Rates tended to be moved incrementally, by 0.25 percentage points at a time.
That was then. The new ânew normalâ since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 has been for the Bank to provide an unprecedented amount of stimulus, not only through bank rate but through buying £375bn of government bonds and by special schemes to encourage credit growth such as Funding for Lending.
The City expects the sixth anniversary of the 0.5% rate to pass before the Bank starts raising rates, and that they will peak at 2.5%-3%. Carney has certainly signalled that he wants them to remain at 0.5% for the foreseeable future.
Those two decades of stability in the 20th century have nothing, however, on the countryâs record period of unchanged rates. In 1719, the Bank raised rates from 4% to 5%. In 1822 it had second thoughts, and brought them back down to 4% again.
