There's a game of cat and mouse going on in the high street. On one side are the retailers keen on selling as much as they can at full price in order to boost profit margins. On the other side are the consumers, intent on winkling the best possible deal out of the big chains.
Judging by the latest inflation figures, it is a game consumers are winning hands down â especially when it comes to clothing and footwear. The latest set of inflation figures showed the headline measure of the annual cost of living falling from 1.9% in June to 1.6% in July. More than two-thirds of this drop was the result of a 5.7% fall in the cost of clothing and footwear, which accounts for £7 of every £100 spent by the average consumer.
There are markdowns every year at New Look, Jigsaw and Clarks. But this year's drop was significantly bigger than the 3.2% decline in July 2013. Last month's bargains followed a small rise in clothing and footwear prices in June as retailers sought to discover whether more than a year of solid growth and falling unemployment had made consumers willing to pay a bit more for their suits, dresses and shoes.
They got their answer. Clothing and footwear sales fell by more than 1% between May and June, according to the Office for National Statistics. Shoppers kept their purses and wallets closed in anticipation that retailers would take a look at racks full of unsold summer fashions and hit the panic button. As prices fell, consumers started to spend a bit more, although the level of clothing and footwear sales in July did not make up all the ground lost in June.
For retailers, there is a twofold message from this summer's trading patterns. The first is that consumers still do not feel all that flush, perhaps unsurprisingly given the continued squeeze on real incomes. The second is that even when living standards do start to rise, it will still be hard to push up profit margins. Consumers, young and old, are increasingly savvy. They know when to sit tight.
