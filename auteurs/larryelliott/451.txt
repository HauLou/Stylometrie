Hindsight is a regulator's worst enemy. Even so, Clive Adamson, the regulator who approved the Rev Paul Flowers as chairman of the Co-op Bank in 2010, would have done better on Tuesday to say he made a straightforward mistake.
Adamson's plea that the decision was justified given "the information I had at the time" was deeply unconvincing.
Forget this year's allegations of drug-taking against Flowers. Forget, too, his conviction in 1981 for gross indecency; Flowers volunteered the information at interview with Adamson but, given that the conviction was spent, it was fair to dismiss its relevance.
Two separate factors were most definitely relevant in 2010. First, Flowers had no senior banking experience.
Given the appalling record in the crisis of banks chaired by non-bankers (Northern Rock, Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS) a red flag should have been raised.
Second, Adamson opted for a messy arrangement that was bound to cause trouble.
He decided that Flowers, despite his lacking of banking expertise, could be approved if two experienced deputy chairmen were on hand.
This apparent safeguard was no use to anybody. Rodney Baker-Bates and David Davies do not appear to have been told they were semi-official spies in the cab.
Worse, when the two deputies warned about the dangers of Co-op Bank's vainglorious attempt to buy 631 Lloyds branches, nothing happened.
Flowers' appointment, in other words, was a muddle. If the Co-op Bank's board was regarded in 2010 as "unruly" â Adamson's description â the right regulatory response would have been to insist on a slimmer version under an experienced and competent chairman.
The calamity at the Co-op â it needs stating â had deeper roots than Flowers' elevation to the chairmanship.
For a start, the bank's misguided takeover of Britannia building society happened in 2009. It would be quite wrong if Flowers is made the fall guy.
But Adamson's approval of Flowers was still "a negligent decision, a very poor decision", as Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, put it.
If that judgment is repeated in the committee's final report, Adamson's hold on the post of head of supervision at the Financial Conduct Authority will be extremely weak.
Is Nick Luff, Centrica's brain-box numbers man since 2007, quitting to join publisher Reed Elsevier because he's bored or ambitious, or is he merely in search of quieter pastures where Ed Miliband won't threaten to impose price controls?
Hard to say, as the man himself did not share his career thinking with either set of shareholders. But he's swapping the finance director's job at a high-profile company worth £17bn for the finance director's same job at a low-profile company worth £19bn. On the face of it, the move does not obviously represent advancement.
Luff, it is said, held no ambitions to succeed Sam Laidlaw as Centrica's chief executive.
In that regard, his exit is different in character to that of Phil Bentley, boss of British Gas, a year ago.
But, from Centrica's point of view, Luff's departure is more troubling. Yes, Reed Elsevier , under chairman Anthony Habgood and chief executive Erik Engstrom, has become a quietly successful international business.
And, yes, the seven-year itch is a fact of life in the executive lane. But is hard to believe that Laidlaw had imagined his finance director would be vulnerable to poaching from that direction.
Call it a comedown for You've got to laugh, writes Well, that's one way of looking at it. What really happened was that retailers had too much stock and panicked, slashing prices in the hope of drumming up some business.
No retailer willingly takes the axe to profit margins at the busiest time of the year.
Consumers were the big winners from the traditional Christmas showdown. But news that a brutal deflation gripped the high street also takes the pressure off Mark Carney at the Bank of England.
If the BRC's survey is accurate, inflation will fall below its 2% target in December, removing any immediate pressure for an increase in borrowing costs.
