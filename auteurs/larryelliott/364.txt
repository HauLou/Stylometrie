An increase of more than 25% in Britain's aid budget lifted financial help to the world's poorest countries to record levels in 2013.
Figures released by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development show that the post-crash slide in assistance came to an end, with aid rising by 6% to $134.8bn (£81bn).
Britain's overseas development assistance climbed by 27.8% as the government met the United Nations target of allocating 0.7% of national output to aid for the first time.
But the report from the OECD's Development Assistance Committee revealed that help to the poorest countries in sub-Saharan Africa fell last year.
"It is heartening to see governments increasing their development aid budgets again, despite the financial constraints they are currently facing," said the OECD's secretary general, Angel Gurría. "However, assistance to some of the neediest countries continues to fall, which is a serious concern."
The Paris-based think tank said the signs were that aid would increase again in 2014 before stabilising. Financial help rose steadily from 1997 to 2010 before being cut back as western governments imposed austerity measures.
The last Labour government made a commitment to the 0.7% aid target and the pledge was reaffirmed by the coalition, which ringfenced the Department of International Development from spending cuts. The DfID budget was not increased in 2011 and 2012 but rose sharply last year.
Britain joined Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and the United Arab Emirates in meeting the UN target. The Netherlands fell below 0.7% for the first time since 1974.
Bilateral aid to sub-Saharan Africa stood at $26.2bn (£15.8bn), a decrease of 4% in real terms from 2012.
