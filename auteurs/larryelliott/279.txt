Hot weather provided a boost for Britain's retailers in July as consumers stocked up on summer clothes and food for the barbecue.
The CBI's monthly snapshot of spending showed activity bounced back strongly this month after a marked slowdown in June.
Almost half of the retailers questioned (46%) said sales were higher than in July 2013, while 25% said they were lower. The gap of +21 points compared with +4 points in June.
The employer's organisation said grocers and shops selling clothes and shoes had enjoyed a good month, while the strength of the housing market provided a boost for furniture and carpet stores.
Barry Williams, the chair of the CBI's distributive trades survey panel and Asda's chief merchandising officer for food, said: "As the temperature began to rise, it seems so did sales volumes. Almost all sectors saw growth, with grocers and clothing stores telling us they performed particularly well as people bought barbeque supplies and summer outfits.
"Retailers expect an even faster rise in sales volumes next month, and are stocking up in anticipation of growing demand."
Richard Lowe, the head of retail and wholesale at Barclays, said: "Consumers are still spending, with the intermittent bursts of sunshine helping to boost the fashion sector as Brits look to update their summer wardrobes. Retailers are bringing in extra stock in the hope that the good weather remains as it's clearly putting a spring in shoppers' steps."
