It is late 2019 and an election is looming. The Conservatives scraped a majority at the last election thanks to a timely boost to the housing market provided by So what does Britain look like in these circumstances? In terms of the size of the state, it is like the Britain of the 1930s. Public spending has fallen to below 35%, lower than the postwar low under Macmillan in the late 1950s and back to the pre-welfare-state years when Neville Chamberlain was starting a rearmament programme. Osborne is offering a return to the world of Ukipâs dreams without the need to vote for Nigel Farage.
Hereâs what it means. Public spending on services, administration and grants by central government account for just 12.6% of national output compared to 21.2% of GDP in the last year of Gordon Brownâs Labour government. Put another way, spending on public services per head is down from £5,650 to £3,880. Around 40% of that reduction in spending took place between 2010 and 2015; the other 60% came after 2015.
These figures are not conjured up out of thin air. They are the projections made by the Office for The Conservatives have no desire to raise taxes. Indeed, they have plans for income tax cuts worth £7bn in the next parliament. Something has to give â and that something is public spending.
Some of the money will come from lower debt interest payments, but the rest will have to come from Whitehall departments and the welfare budget.
Little of this was mentioned in Osborneâs autumn statement. The grim state of the public finances and the implications for public spending in the next parliament were deftly margarined away by the stamp-duty giveaway and other populist moves designed to shore up the Conservative partyâs core vote in Middle England. But itâs not hard to see why Vince Cable is incandescent about the Treasury plans for the public finances. The cuts to welfare and to unprotected departments (everything other than the NHS, schools and international aid) will be cumulatively enormous â and almost certainly unachievable. They are certainly unachievable without putting the economy at risk, which is why the OBR has cut its growth forecasts from 2016 onwards.
âThe governmentâs fiscal plans imply three successive years of cash reductions in government consumption of goods and services from 2016 onwards, the first since 1948,â the OBR notes. âThe corresponding real cuts directly reduce GDP. The economy should be able to adjust to such changes over time, but it is unlikely to be a simple process when monetary policy is already very loose and external demand subdued.â
This looks very much like a rerun of the early years of the current parliament, when Osborne assumed that the negative impact of his deficit reduction plan would be more than offset by a growth-friendly Bank of England, which was stimulating activity by keeping official interest rates at 0.5% and pumping newly created electronic money into the economy through quantitative easing.
It didnât work. The economy pretty much flatlined for the first half of the current parliament and only really started to recover when the government abandoned hopes of rebalancing the economy towards investment and exports, falling back on a housing boom instead. As Trevor Greetham of Fidelity rightly noted, the changes to stamp duty were âone last roll of the dice before the election. It isnât obvious where the offsetting stimulus comes from if housing continues to slow and UK government spending is cut back as anticipated in the next parliament.â
It certainly isnât. Osborne appears to have learned nothing from his first experiment in âexpansionary fiscal contractionâ â the idea that getting tough with the deficit would help the economy by boosting private sector confidence.
The big question, of course, is whether Osborne (or his successor as chancellor) will have the opportunity to put his draconian public spending plans into action. He did his best to bury the bad news in a statement that was clearly focused heavily on the next five months.
Certainly, there were a few supply-side measures designed to boost productivity, encourage research and development, and improve skills. But this was a package that aimed to disguise the poor state of the public finances and to suggest that the second half of the 10-year debt reduction programme can be relatively painless thanks to a Google tax, to less generous tax relief for banks on their bad debts, and to the lower costs of servicing the national debt.
But the nitty-gritty of the OBR report suggests otherwise. This side of the election Osborne is offering help for orchestras, hospices and childrenâs TV programmes. After the election, he has plans to double down on austerity, to target the poor and to shrink the state.
