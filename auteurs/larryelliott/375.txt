the jumbo jets that allegedly cost Labour the 1970 election. Forget Nigel Lawson and the import binge of the 1980s. Britain has never seen bigger current account deficits than those it is notching up right now.
Back in the 1960s, a deficit of 1% of national output would have been seen as dangerously high. A 3% deficit would have had investors heading for the exits, prompting a run on sterling. The shortfalls in the third and fourth quarters of 2013 averaged 5.5% of GDP, we learned last week, and yet the pound is seen as a safe-haven currency.
This sanguine view of Britain's struggle to pay its way in the world may not last. Traditionally, less attention is paid to the UK's external accounts during tough times. Growth and unemployment are the indicators most closely watched.
Once the threat of recession is banished, the GDP and labour market figures quickly become old hat. The focus switches from growth to over-heating and the measures that count are house prices, inflation, consumer spending and the balance of payments.
That shift is starting to happen. Eyebrows were raised in the City last Friday at the size of a current account deficit that would be high even at the peak of a raging boom, let alone after nine months of a recovery from the worst recession in living memory.
Concern is warranted. The past 15 years have seen the UK's share of world trade decline by 25%. The collapse in Britain's investment income since the financial crisis has exposed the structural weakness of trade in goods. Oil no longer provides the crutch it once did. And, unlike in previous cycles, a big depreciation of the currency has failed to lift the UK back into the black.
Over the past year, a third of the 30% depreciation in sterling that occurred between 2007 and early 2009 has unwound. Investors have become more convinced of the UK's recovery and they think that the Bank of England will raise interest rates before the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan. Money has come into Britain, pushing up the level of sterling. That has made imports cheaper, helping to nudge the inflation rate below 2%, but is making life tougher for exporters.
The Bank of England would view any further appreciation in the pound as unwelcome, since it would hinder the rebalancing of the economy. But other than a bit of jawboning, there is not much Threadneedle Street can do. Cutting interest rates is one way of pulling down the value of a currency but they are already at 0.5%. Pumping more pounds into circulation through quantitative easing could be another way of achieving the same result, but the Bank has no desire to add to the £375bn of gilts it has bought since early 2009.
Sterling's strength suggests the financial markets are happy to finance the deficit and so allow Britain to live beyond its means. The problem is that an untreated deficit is the same as a serious but untreated medical condition: eventually it can no longer be ignored.
The UK's current account has two big components. The first is trade in manufactured goods, food, oil and services. Despite a healthy monthly surplus in trade in services â such things as banking, insurance, management consultancy, law and advertising â an even bigger monthly deficit in manufactured goods means trade is always in the red.
The second component includes transfers to and from international bodies such as the UN and the European Union, and investment income â the difference between what Britain makes on its overseas investments and what overseas investors make on their investments here. There was a large surplus in investment income in the pre-crash years, but this was largely the result of the willingness of UK investors to take risky, but high yielding bets. Investment income bounces around from quarter to quarter, but the trend in the more cautious post-crisis environment has been downwards.
John Mills, businessman and donor to the Labour party, has written a pamphlet for the thinktank Civitas, called There is an Alternative, in which he concludes that rebalancing the economy and securing a lasting increase in the growth rate requires a big fall in the value of sterling.
The paper says that cutting the value of the pound by 31% in 2014 and holding it at that level would allow the economy to expand by 4-5% a year, double investment in the next five years and reverse the decline in manufacturing as a share of GDP. This could be achieved while keeping the inflation rate at 3% and while delivering real increases in consumer spending each year.
It all sounds remarkably simple, but don't expect the Mills blueprint to become official Labour party policy any time soon.

For a start, it is unclear how the government could arrange a 31% depreciation of the currency in a floating exchange rate world. Britain's ability to exploit the drop in the value of the pound would depend on increasing industrial capacity fast. But a hefty proportion of the investment goods necessary to make this happen would need to be imported because they are no longer made domestically. These would become more expensive.
The same applies to energy, food and consumer goods, where import penetration is also high. The poor, who spend more of their incomes on staples, would suffer unless there was considerable redistribution of income. On past form, Britain's manufacturers would not use the 31% depreciation to expand market share, but would plump up their profit margins instead.
Two final points. Manufacturing would get some boost from a much lower pound, but the big winner would be the service sector, already hyper-competitive and which has the capacity to expand quickly. And is it the triumph of hope over experience to imagine that the UK could combine 4-5% growth with 3% inflation?
In the past 100 years, Britain has come off the gold standard, devalued the pound in 1949 and 1967, had a colossal sterling crisis in 1976 and been blown out of the exchange rate mechanism in 1992.
Getting the exchange rate right is part of the rebalancing story, but only part of the solution. The Asian tiger economies made sure they had under-valued currencies when they embarked on rapid industrialisation. So did China. But they also protected their infant industries, identified manufacturing sectors they wanted to exploit, squeezed consumption in order to divert resources into investment and exports, and deployed capital controls to prevent their strategy being blown off course. These were developing countries that thought of themselves as developing countries. If Britain is serious about rebalancing and re-industrialisation, it will take more than a change in the exchange rate, it will take a change of mindset.
