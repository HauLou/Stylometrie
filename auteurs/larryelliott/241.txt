In a faint echo of those turbulent days after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the City has woken up to the possibility that the Scots will decide to go it alone. Sunday's YouGov poll for the Sunday Times showing the first ever lead for yes â albeit at 51% to 49% â should clarify thinking further. The Bank of England has begun to draw up contingency plans to cope with the potential fallout from the end of a union that has lasted for more than 300 years.
On the estates of Glasgow, where Iain Duncan Smith once came to outline his vision for welfare reform, supporters of independence are telling people who haven't voted since Margaret Thatcher used them as guinea pigs for the poll tax that they have the chance to be rid of the Tories for ever.
The narrowing polls raise the prospect of a divorce that could be long, complex and bitter. The pound has been coming under pressure as it has become clear that the race is rapidly becoming a far closer call than anyone but diehard Scottish nationalists had ever envisaged. "In some ways it is a bigger challenge than 2008," Darling says during a visit to Aberdeen. "This is about the future of the country in which I live. I don't want to take a leap into the unknown."
Clearly not all Scots see it that way. Many say they are taking the leap with their eyes wide open. They have been told by George Osborne and Ed Balls that there is no possibility that an independent But Dave Moxham, deputy general secretary of the Scottish TUC, says: "The direction is only one way. And that is from undecided voters to yes. Whether it will be enough to win I am not sure, but it is a noticeable trend."
John Swinney is the Scottish National party's answer to Darling: calm, cautious, a safe pair of hands. Sitting in Yes Scotland's HQ in Hope Street, Glasgow, he puts the case for independence in one short sentence. "I think we will make a better job of running the country ourselves rather than having decisions made by the UK government."
There are five reasons why this argument resonates. The first is that Scotland, like Wales and many of the northern regions of England, still bears deep scars from the deindustrialisation of the 1980s.
The second is that the once in a lifetime windfall of North Sea oil â Scotland's oil, in the minds of many â has not been used to alleviate the effects of the profound economic shock that led to the closures in the coalmines and the shipyards. Nationalists say the money that could and should have been used to rebuild and reshape the economy after the collapse of heavy industry has instead been blown on unemployment benefits, tax cuts and expensive wars.
Speaking to a breakfast meeting in Aberdeen organised by Oil & Gas UK, the lobby group for the offshore industry, Fergus Ewing, Scotland's energy minister, notes that Norway salted away a large chunk of its North Sea revenues into a sovereign wealth fund which has assets of more than £500bn and has been buying up chunks of expensive Mayfair real estate. "The UK is almost alone of the oil countries of the world in having an oil fund of zero," Ewing says.
The third issue is a conviction that the UK's economy and UK economic policy is too dominated by London. It is not just that there are specific grievances: the lack of superfast broadband in rural areas; the long wait for a relief road round Aberdeen, cited by Ewing in his speech. It is also that Scots see benefits from devolution and think they could do better with more power. Small is beautiful is playing well.
A fourth factor is austerity, which rankles in a country where the real political fight is between the Scottish National party and Labour, and where there is only one Conservative MP. Darling accepts that this is a factor helping the yes camp. "There have been six years of austerity and people are looking for an escape. They think that with independence we won't have any of these problems."
Westminster-dictated austerity will continue even if Ed Miliband emerges victorious in next year's UK general election. Pat Rafferty, general secretary of the Unite union in Scotland, says: "Better Together shouldn't underestimate how people are looking ahead to the 2015 election and thinking that even if Labour wins the austerity will go on."
Finally, there is the economic state of modern Scotland, simultaneously a rich and a poor country. In terms of the UK regions it ranks third in terms of income per head after London and the south-east. Edinburgh is the heart of the biggest concentration of financial services firms outside London, and Aberdeen is the home of the oil industry. Scotland has a thriving biomedical sector, and a big defence, marine and aerospace presence. The food and drink industry has some strong global brands which have been helped by the attention on Scotland generated by the referendum. Much poorer countries than Scotland have gone it alone.
On the other hand, the cost of deindustrialisation has been high, with concentrated pockets of joblessness and poverty. That's why Yes Scotland is picking up support in what were once Labour fiefdoms, as the latest polls show.
Better Together's economic arguments tend to be about what Scotland stands to lose by going it alone. Privately, there is concern that the campaign has been negative. Publicly, the line is that there is a silent majority worried about the implications of independence.
The list of concerns is headed by the currency question. There are really only four options: a currency union with the rest of the UK; using sterling without a currency union in the way that Panama uses the dollar; joining the euro; or an independent monetary policy with a new Scottish currency and interest rates set by a Scottish central bank.
Salmond and Swinney favour a currency union and insist that George Osborne and Ed Balls are bluffing when they rule it out. Successful negotiations will take place after the referendum, Swinney says. "It makes sense to have a currency union. The drivers behind it will become clearer the more we get out of the political space and into the practical space."
Not so, says Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat chief secretary to the Treasury: "There isn't going to be a currency union. Do finance ministers go around bluffing? It is essential to the national interest that you don't bluff."
Alexander says the opposition to a currency union in Westminster is economic, not political. "In a currency union you are asking the rest of the UK to expose itself to risks it isn't able to control. As we have seen in Europe, monetary union requires political union."
The austerity debate also cuts both ways. Public spending is higher in Scotland than in the UK as a whole, and the population is ageing more quickly. Britain's leading experts on tax and spending matters, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, have made a bleak assessment of what lies ahead after independence: "Despite the considerable uncertainty surrounding the future path of borrowing and debt in Scotland, the main conclusion of our analysis is that a significant further fiscal tightening would be required in Scotland, on top of that announced by the UK government, in order to put Scotland's long-term public finances on to a sustainable footing." Gordon Brown, the former prime minister, has been making this point more starkly. Pensions, he has said, will be at risk.
Yes Scotland has said this is a scare story. It has said a better productivity performance and rising North Sea oil revenues will make the budgetary position less grim.
But productivity improvements will take time and North Sea oil is not the cash cow it once was. There are plenty of reserves left in the waters round Scotland, including new fields to the west of Shetland. The difficulty is that the oil is expensive to get at. New technologies will help but the industry will demand, and almost certainly get, tax breaks in order to drill the crude from the sea. The tax take per barrel will go down.
Then there's Europe. Negotiations for Scotland to become a member state of the European Union will take place alongside talks with Westminster on the currency.
Better Together says it is not a foregone conclusion that Scotland will be allowed in, particularly since countries such as Belgium and Spain have their own strong separatist movements. The former EU commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, Olli Rehn, has said Scotland would need its own central bank to be considered for membership.
Finally, the rich and poor argument works for the no side as well. The swankier parts of Edinburgh look and feel like central London. The property market is as hot in Aberdeen as it is in the home counties. If you are doing well, the argument goes, why risk it?
The industrial sector has its special concerns. Bryan Buchan, chief executive of Scottish Engineering, said some firms had been deferring investment in the runup to the referendum. Scotland's economy is highly integrated with the rest of the UK and the high percentage of foreign ownership in finance, energy and food and drink makes it vulnerable to capital flight. The defence sector is worried that orders for the Royal Navy will dry up.
As the referendum nears, Better Together will be stressing that the poor will become poorer if goods become more expensive, mortgages go up, and prices in the shops rise if firms relocate or the Scottish government has to pay higher interest rates to borrow money.
Both sides promise the best of all worlds: higher public spending, cuts in corporation tax, better conditions for workers, less draconian welfare rules coupled with the pound and the Bank of England as the lender of last resort according to the yes camp; more devolved tax powers coupled with the security that comes from being part of a country of 60 million rather than 5 million people according to the Better Together camp.
So what would life really be like after independence? Some businesses, particularly in the financial sector, would migrate south. Others would stay but would lobby hard for the sort of business-friendly conditions (low tax, light-touch regulation) that would infuriate some independence supporters. If a deal on a currency can be achieved, the Bank of England and the Treasury will insist on terms that tie Swinney's hands.
In its assessment, the Scottish TUC notes: "The extent to which a future Scottish government would be permitted (by fiscal agreements and currency choice) to pursue markedly different policy on tax is a question which requires further examination, and honesty, from both sides of the debate."
It will also become clear from the continuation of austerity and of Bank of England control over interest rates that what Scotland has actually got is independence lite.
As Brown puts it in his book My Scotland Our Britain, "it has now become clear that one power that the nationalists have always demanded â full control over the economy â is now one the Scottish government says it doesn't want".
The new government would use business-friendly policies to prevent companies leaving, and be accused of selling out when it does so.
Equally clearly, Scotland would not face economic collapse or ruin. Countries much poorer than Scotland have thrived after independence. But it would not be a land flowing with milk and honey either. Gavin McCrone, author of a book on the pros and cons of independence (Scottish Independence: Weighing Up the Economics), says: "Scotland could survive but it would be tough in the early years. The fiscal position would be pretty tight."
That looks unarguable. Even so, as decision day approaches, it has been the pro-union camp that has struggled to get its message across. That becomes apparent when Darling, enjoying a chicken tandoori in the Light of Bengal in Aberdeen, is recognised and approached by the manager, who wants to talk about the referendum.
"Which side are you on?" he asks the man who has been the face of Better Together for two and a half years. Darling, a man of infinite patience, says through only the faintest of gritted teeth: "I'm a no."
