The Here's the lowdown. Central banks such as the Fed and the Bank of England learned lessons from the Great Depression, a disaster caused by a shrinking of the money supply exacerbated by austerity. Since the crash of 2008-09 both the Fed and the Old Lady have flooded their economies with cash in an attempt to offset the drying up of bank credit. In both Washington and London there has been a recognition that seeking to hit budget targets in a low-growth environment by cutting spending or raising taxes simply makes matters worse. There is an acknowledgement that Keynes lived.
Europe has done things differently. It has not responded to the shrinking of credit in the aggressive manner of the Fed or the Bank of England. There has been no quantitative easing, no funding for lending schemes, no attempt to clean up the balance sheets of troubled banks. Slow growth has led to calls for already mouth-wateringly tight fiscal policy to be toughened up. The message has been that macro-economic policy is only of limited importance and that supply side reforms are the answer. The do-nothing decision by the ECB on Thursday came as no surprise.
But Europe's experiment is doomed to fail. Weak money and credit growth plus austerity will result in the weak eurozone recovery being aborted, sooner rather than later if the emerging market crisis intensifies. Deflationary pressures will intensify. In the not-too-distant future the ECB's president, Mario Draghi, will be able to insist on a more aggressive monetary policy. Why? Because the internal ECB battle is between Draghi, a man who thinks macro-economic policy matters, and the Bundesbank, a central bank that thinks economic history ended in 1929.
