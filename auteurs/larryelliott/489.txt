Prospects of any early rise in interest rates are receding after the 
Revealing the thinking behind the decision to leave policy unchanged at its meeting earlier this month, Threadneedle Street's monetary policy committee said inflation had fallen more quickly than anticipated and there was no immediate threat to the economy from cost pressures.

Minutes of the November meeting show that all nine MPC members agreed to keep official interest rates at 0.5% and to maintain the stock of government bonds bought under the Bank's quantitative easing programme at £375bn.

Although the Bank is expecting the economy to grow by 0.9% in the final three months of 2013, the MPC is unsure both about the durability of the recovery and the extent to which growth in the economy's supply capacity will keep pace with rising demand for goods and services.

In August, the Bank provided forward guidance in which it said it would not consider raising interest rates before unemployment fell to 7% â unless there was a threat from inflation or a housing bubble. The latest set of labour market data showed the jobless rate falling to 7.6%.

The minutes admit that the Bank's projections showing inflation falling next year as output returns to its pre-recession levels are likely to be wrong, but add that provided there are no signs of an inflationary mentality becoming embedded there could be a case for not raising interest rates even when unemployment reaches the 7% threshold.

"Once unemployment had reached 7%, the committee would reassess what it had learned about the nature of the recovery", the minutes say.
