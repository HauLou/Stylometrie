Banks will have access to a Speaking in Brazil, the chancellor said billions of pounds of extra loans would be made available to UK firms competing in global markets after the Bank broadened the support it provides to lenders. Osborne has set British companies a target of doubling exports to £1tn by 2020.
The chancellor's comments came before the release of Tuesday's quarterly economic survey from the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), which shows service export orders at their strongest on record and manufacturing export orders at their highest for more than three years.
Following Osborne's announcement, loans guaranteed by Britain's export credit agency, UK Export Finance (UKEF), will now fall under the Bank's sterling monetary framework, which provides financial help in times of unexpected stress by agreeing to provide liquid assets in exchange for high-quality collateral.
Osborne said: "Banks will now have access to a special Bank of England facility that will make it much less risky for them to extend loans to our exporters. That should mean billions of extra lending will be made available to our exporters. And it will mean cheaper lending, saving potentially millions of pounds for large projects."
The Treasury said the scheme could help reduce the cost of private-sector export finance loans by up to 0.1% and was the second part of a package that included the budget announcement of a doubling to £3bn of the UKEF publicly funded lending facility to exporters. Sources said there had been a sea change in attitudes, towards how to back exports.
Osborne said his aim was to give the UK the most competitive export finance in Europe and put it on a par with that of the US, the only other developed nation that offers help to private sector export finance through its central bank. "For decades we have not been exporting enough â not just to Brazil, but to all the fastest growing markets in the world. So I am confronting that historic weakness head-on."
Commenting on the BCC's latest quarterly survey, the organisation's director general, John Longworth, said: "Confidence is high and our members are determined to continue driving the recovery. We are brilliant at services and very successful at exporting our knowledge-based industries all over the world. This includes everything from accountancy and marketing through to literature and the IT sector."
The BCC said its survey was upbeat overall, with six of the indicators for manufacturing â domestic sales, domestic orders, employment expectations, investment in plant and machinery, investment in training, and turnover confidence â at record levels. But it said the fall in employment in the service sector over the past three months was a concern. Inflation was the biggest worry for manufacturing and service sector companies.
"Access to finance and export support also remain vital if we are to secure a truly great economic recovery", Longworth said. "Only by repairing our broken business finance system will viable, growing firms gain access to the capital that will allow them to invest in their staff and machinery, and enter new markets. And despite recent falls, inflation remains a key concern for our businesses, and the Bank of England must strive to maintain an investment-friendly environment, with clarity on forward interest rates and action to keep inflation low."
