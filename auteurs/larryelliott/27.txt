The threat of Greece welching on its debts by the end of the week is concentrating minds. After a mini-summit in Berlin attended by the heads of the European commission, the 
Alexis Tsiprasâs government was denying all knowledge of a new plan to break the deadlock, but one thing is certain: this Greek drama can end in only one of three ways. 

Option one is that Greece leaves the euro, by accident or design. Greece could decide that the troikaâs terms are too harsh. The troika could lose patience and throw 
A Grexit now would probably cause fewer economic shockwaves than it would have done two or three years ago, but there would still be knock-on effects on Europe and the wider global community. The political ramifications would be more serious. Greek departure would embolden anti-austerity parties across Option two is a Greek cave in. Tsipras has been trying to ride two horses at once : the desire of Greek voters to both end austerity and stay in the euro. The moment is rapidly arriving when Tsipras has to decide which of the two goals is the more important, because it looks as if he canât achieve both. But if Tsipras is going to capitulate, he is showing little sign of it. The late-night meeting in Berlinsuggests the troika is worried. All that points to option three, a good old-fashioned euro fudge. This would involve Greeceâs creditors watering down their austerity demands and providing the bridging finance that would allow Tsipras to meet the series of debt repayments due this summer. This would provide the breathing space for a referendum to be held on whether the Greeks believe yet more austerity is a price worth paying for staying in the euro, and for negotiations on the big long-term issue: the need for some of Greeceâs debt to be written off. Athens would give a solemn commitment to step up the pace of economic reform; the troika would say that any backsliding will result in the money being cut off.
