Britain has recovered little of the ground lost during the deep recession of 2008-09 once a rising population is taken into account, the Announcing seven alternative ways of measuring economic well-being, the ONS said on Monday that per capita gross domestic product remained well below its peak in 2013.
"Unlike GDP, which has now recovered substantially from the falls in the recent recession, GDP per capita has recovered only a little of the fall seen during the recession," the UK's statistical agency said.
It said GDP remained the "central and indispensable" measure of activity in the UK economy but said a "dashboard" of supplementary measures would help assess changes in wellbeing.
The ONS said these were:
The ONS said: "Given that it measures aggregate activity in the economy, GDP, supported by other information, inevitably and correctly plays a central role in discussion about monetary and fiscal policy and about the state of the economy generally. It is therefore of vital importance."
But it added: "At the same time, GDP has long known weaknesses as a measure of economic welfare or wellbeing."
The ONS said the UK's recent performance looked different depending on which dashboard measure was used.
While GDP is likely to exceed its 2008 peak during 2014, the statistical agency said GDP per head was still 8% lower than it was before the recession. Real net national disposable income per capita dropped from £23,000 before the crash to £20,000 in 2012, when it was still falling.
But real adjusted household disposable income per head, which takes account of the monetary value of health and education services received free of charge, held up well during the deepest part of the recession. It then declined gently during the period when GDP was picking up.
The ONS said it was working on ways to improve the dashboard by including human capital and natural capital.
