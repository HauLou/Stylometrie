But every silver lining has a cloud, and for Greening the cloud is that justifying spending more on poor people overseas is a hard sell when living standards and public services are being squeezed at home.
That's especially true when large chunks of the country are under water, and it was no surprise to hear Nigel Farage demanding last week that part of the international development budget be diverted to help flood victims.
Although One such cause is educating the Syrian children who have fled across the border into Lebanon, which formed a new government at the weekend after months of political deadlock.
Here's how things stand. At the last count there were 300,000 Syrians of school age living as refugees in Lebanon is a small country â population four million â struggling to cope with the influx. It is as if London were faced with finding school places for all the children in Manchester and Birmingham, or New York landed with the children of Chicago and Washington DC â only worse, because Lebanon is poorer than the UK and the US and its economy is suffering collateral damage from the conflict in Before the civil war, almost every child in Syria was in school. It had a good record for enrolment at primary and secondary level. Many of those children are now in Lebanon where only one in eight children aged six to 14 is in school. To put that in context, that is less than half the level in South Sudan.
For secondary school-age children the situation is even more grim, with only 5% being educated. Many of the children who have fled Syria have been traumatised by their experiences, including seeing classmates killed by sniper fire while on the way to school. Some are being catered for by the Lebanese education system, but many more are being sent out to work and beg. Girls as young as 13 have been sold into marriage.
The risk here is obvious. There will be a lost generation of Syrian children who receive next to no education and grow up full of anger and resentment. Greening has put £30m into the No Lost Generation initiative, designed to provide Syrian children with education, protection and emotional support.
But the humanitarian response to the Syrian conflict is not sufficient to deal with the education crisis in Lebanon. According to Kevin Watkins, the director of Britain's Overseas Development Institute, less than half of the humanitarian financing requested for Lebanon has been delivered and very little of it has found its way into schools, where around 30,000 Syrian children are being educated. Something bigger, more ambitious, and more immediate is needed.
Watkins has come up with a solution for the UN that is being championed by Watkins estimates the cost of his plan would be about $500m (£300m) over three years and says it should be delivered jointly by the UN children's agency, Unicef, and the Lebanese government. Donors would put money into a pooled fund, which would be overseen by an accounting firm such as PwC to ensure that the money was properly spent.
It is a good plan, offering value for money and hope of a future for the displaced children of Syria. What it lacks at the moment is cash and political momentum, both of which Greening is in a position to provide.
Britain has been generous in its response to the Syrian crisis. Its humanitarian aid has broken records, and the UK is second only to the US in the international list of donors. Most of that aid is for survival â food, shelter and medicines â but some will trickle down into the education system.
That said, the only UK aid money specifically aimed at education is £4m for textbooks, only 25% of which will be spent on Syrian refugees. Alan Duncan, the international development minister, said in the Commons last week that the government supported Brown's proposal and intended to do more. That was a clear signal that Greening intends to put money behind the scheme.
A financial commitment by the UK would be welcome, although as always the devil is in the detail. Greening needs to put a sizeable amount in the pot and use the pledge to put pressure on the other big donors â such as the EU and the US â to match or better it.
Greening is a careful operator. She likes to weigh up the options and pick the best one. That's fair enough, provided caution does not become an excuse for inertia. To be sure, there are a number of ideas out there for how to educate refugee children from Syria in Lebanon, but none look as workable and cost-effective as the Watkins blueprint.
This is the perfect chance for Greening to sock it to her domestic critics. UK aid money is needed to prevent today's lost generation of children becoming tomorrow's terrorists, something that gets likelier as more and more years of schooling are lost. As Watkins said: "We've had a lot of encouraging statements of intent. But in the last analysis the international community has stood by and watched 1 million kids have their right to education taken away. This is probably greatest reversal in education of the post-war period."
Or, to put it another way, if this is not a suitable use of Greening's £11bn a year budget, what exactly is it there for?
