Nearly half the jobs in parts of Britain pay less than the living wage, the The TUC said a breakdown of official figures showed that on average around 20% of workers are earning less than the living wage â an informal and unenforceable benchmark â but that this rose to almost 50% in some parliamentary constituencies.
Designed to top up the legally-binding national minimum wage, the living wage is set at £8.80 an hour in London and £7.65 for the rest of the country. Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, says he wants to include the idea as part of Labour's 2015 manifesto, while David Cameron says he supports a living wage in principle.
The TUC said that in total around 5 million people were being paid less than the living wage, with some of the areas with the greatest concentration of the low paid seen in parts of outer London.
Kingswood, near Bristol, is the constituency with the highest number of people earning less than the living wage (48%), followed by the London seats of Chingford and Woodford Green (43.4%) and Harrow West (42.4%).
By contrast, parts of inner London vied with the stockbroker belt of Surrey to have the fewest people paid less than the living wage.
The breakdown shows that Poplar and Limehouse, which includes the financial centre of Canary Wharf, has the fewest people earning less than £8.80 an hour (5.6%), followed by Runneymede and Weybridge (5.8%).
Low pay has moved up the political agenda as living standards have been squeezed during the recession of 2008-09 and its aftermath. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility said last month that it did not expect the real (inflation-adjusted) level of earnings to exceed their pre-recession 2008 levels until 2016.
The TUC said its report was meant to coincide with the 15th anniversary of the national minimum wage in April 1999.
Its general secretary Frances O'Grady said: "Extending the living wage is a vital way of tackling the growing problem of in-work poverty across Britain.
"Working families are experiencing the biggest pressure on their living standards since Victorian times. "The number of living wage employers is growing rapidly and unions are playing their part in encouraging more employers to sign up and pay it â but the government must show equal initiative. We need to see a far greater commitment to pay the living wage from government and employers, and modern wages councils which could set higher minimum rates in industries where employers can afford to pay their staff more."
