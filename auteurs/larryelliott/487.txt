latest data for the public finances. The good news is that borrowing in the first seven months of the financial year is 8% down on the same period of 2012-13. On current trends, the deficit will be around £15bn lower for the full year than the chancellor expected at the time of the budget in the spring.
That leaves Osborne in the position to offer a few sweeteners to the public in his autumn statement on 5 December. He is likely to resist the temptation for now to indulge in a pre-election giveaway, not least because borrowing is still on course to be a chunky £105bn this year. Even so, it is a nice choice to have.
The bad news for the chancellor is that lower borrowing is largely the result of higher VAT and stamp duty receipts. Treasury coffers are benefiting from a surge in consumer spending and the pick-up in the housing market. The bog-standard UK recovery, in other words, but not quite what Osborne promised back in 2010.
To be fair, the latest snapshot of industry from the CBI shows that stronger domestic demand is boosting the order books and output of manufacturers. This, though, has yet to be reflected in corporation tax receipts, which were 8% lower in October than they were a year earlier.
Labour made the point that the coalition has borrowed more in the past three years than Labour did in its 13 years in office, and that this is a measure of how austerity has failed even on its own terms. Whether the opposition will get any political traction with this argument remains to be seen.
Polling evidence suggests that voters believe that the Gordon Brown government rather than the global financial crisis was responsible for the big deterioration in the public finances between 2007 and 2010. Osborne's argument since he became chancellor is that it has been left to him to clear up an unholy mess left by Labour. We are likely to hear more of this on 5 December.
