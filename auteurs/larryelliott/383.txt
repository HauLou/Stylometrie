George Osborne's fifth budget was constructed like a classic Gordon Brown package: some gratuitous boasting at the start, a chunky middle section containing supply-side measures, and a rabbit out of the hat at the end to cheer up his own supporters. Far more content-rich than most had anticipated, the package had three broad themes.
The first was the state of the economy, where the chancellor had some good news to report from the independent Office for The less good news is that faster growth now means slightly weaker growth later. Although gross domestic product is around 15% lower than it would have been had it continued to grow at its historic rate for the past six years, the OBR sees little hope of much of this lost output ever being recovered. Instead, it thinks the output gap â the measure of spare capacity in the economy â will have pretty much closed after two more years of modest growth.
As a result, Osborne announced a whole host of changes designed to improve the long-term performance of the economy and bring about the rebalancing that he has been talking about â but failing to deliver â since he arrived at the Treasury four years ago. He announced more help for exporters, doubled investment allowances and cut the cost of industry's energy bills. It was everything business had hoped for, and more.
Finally, there was the reform of savings, including more generous ISAs, new pensioner bonds and â most signficant of all â the death knell for the annuity signalled by the right for pensioners to take control of their own pension pots. The impact of these changes will be felt over many years, but will probably lead to some immediate increase in spending. They are also designed to woo a core Conservative constituency: better-off pensioners thinking of voting Ukip.
