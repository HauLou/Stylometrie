The chances of an early end to Greeceâs standoff with its eurozone partners appeared to be fading as Wolfgang Schäuble, Germanyâs finance minister, said the Syriza-led coalition government headed by Schäubleâs comments prompted an instant retort from the Greek government, with a spokesman in Athens saying that Berlin was also acting irresponsibly.
Pressure is mounting on the finance ministers from the 19-strong euro group to find a way of negotiating an extension of Greeceâs credit terms before the deadline at the end of the month.
Tsipras said on Sunday that he expected the talks to be difficult but that he was confident  about a successful outcome. Greece wants the euro group to ease Greeceâs debt burden and to remove some of the conditions imposed in return for a bailout.
Germany has hinted that it would be prepared to see some modest adjustment to Greeceâs debts but only if Tsipras continued to abide by the agreements signed by previous governments. 
Schäuble said in a radio interview that he was âvery scepticalâ about the talks. 
âI feel sorry for the Greeks at the moment. Theyâve elected a government which is currently acting irresponsibly,â Schäuble said.


Kit Juckes, currency strategist at âKicking cans down roads is the EUâs forte and the most likely outcome of negotiations with Greece is still that a temporary deal is reached so that talks can continue and funding be maintained for now.â


But Marc Ostwald, of ADM Investor Services, said he felt there would only be limited progress from the talks.
âIt appears unlikely that there will be even a short-term âbridgeâ agreement between Greece and the euro group at todayâs meeting, but it is to be hoped that some further common ground can be found.â


The gloomier mood surrounding the talks made it more expensive for the Greek government to service its national debt, currently 175% of annual national output. The interest rate on three-year Greek debt rose by almost 1.5 percentage points to 17.15%, while the interest rate on 10-year bonds was up by just under 0.25 points to 9.74%.
