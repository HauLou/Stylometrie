Britain's model of corporate governance is doggedly short-termist. Nothing new about that. There have been calls for the UK to copy the German model, with its supportive investors and long-termist banks, for decades.
What, though, if the way our companies are run is contributing to the problem of inequality? That was the suggestion made by the Bank of England's Andy Haldane, when he said there was a case for firms looking after all stakeholders rather than just shareholders.
Haldane's argument goes as follows. Humans have problems deferring gratification. Given the choice between having something now or having a bit more later, we find it hard to wait. That goes for consumers, but it also goes for people who own and run companies.
And if power resides with this particular group, what you get is widening inequality â because the fruits of a company's growth go disproportionately into raising executive pay and dividends, rather than into higher real earnings and investment. "The shareholder model may, ironically, have contributed to unfair shares," Haldane says.
All this seems to fit with what has been happening in Britain over the past couple of decades. Haldane says there is a case for fundamental corporate governance reform that would provide a different set of incentives and skew companies towards delivering long-term value for a broader range of stakeholders.
It's hard to quibble with that. The way companies are run does seem to be a factor in the widening gap between rich and poor. The decline of collective bargaining means that trade unions are less able to act as a counterweight to shareholder power. What's more, other countries have managed to move to a model biased towards investing rather than distributing.
What Haldane doesn't do is explain how this change will come about. History suggests resistance to reform will be implacable.
