A penny off a pint. Cheaper long-haul flights. Petrol duty frozen. A real corker of a package if you are a bingo-playing pensioner who likes a tot of the hard stuff and has a few quid in the bank. In some ways, George Osborne's fifth budget was exactly the sort of affair you would imagine with a year to go before a general election.
The chancellor made sure that there was no repeat of the "omnishambles" of two years ago. There was house-building, support for regional theatre and a pledge that Britain will cash in on its discovery of graphene. Not a pasty tax or a granny tax anywhere in sight.
But all the headline-grabbing stuff was beside the point. The real gist of Osborne's speech was that Britain remains a country in deep, deep trouble. He promised to level with voters, and duly did so. Although growth is now picking up, the deficit is too high and investment too low. Britain, he said, had 20 years of catching up to do and the budget marks the start of the long haul ahead.
It was, of course, a speech that glossed over any failings on the chancellor's part. Osborne is the first to admit that the Treasury coffers remain empty and upfront about the need for austerity to continue deep into the next parliament. But he has real trouble accepting that he might be in any way responsible for the fact that borrowing in 2014-15 is expected to be £96bn against the £37bn predicted in the first coalition budget in June 2010.
Instead, his message to voters is that Labour left the country skint and it has taken far longer than he imagined to put things right. No mention of the increase in VAT that slowed the economy in 2010 and 2011; no regrets for the over-the-top comparisons between Britain and Greece; no hint of an acknowledgement that austerity might have held back recovery.
All that said, Osborne's assessment of the fundamental state of the economy is right. For decades, weaknesses have been papered over by debt, North Sea oil and the willingness of other countries to allow us to live beyond our means. The challenge of raising investment, boosting production and increasing saving will face whichever party wins the 2015 election.
It was this candid analysis of what needs to be done that framed the budget. It had five key themes.
Theme number one is the state of the economy. Here the news has been markedly better since last year's budget, when the That looks unlikely unless the crisis in Ukraine takes a marked turn for the worse or China implodes. The Bank of England's cheap money policy should ensure that the economy hums along nicely until polling day, even though the OBR thinks that the quarterly growth rate will slow during the course of 2014.
The less good news is that the budget forecasts assume that the bulk of the damage caused by the Great Recession was permanent. Normally in the aftermath of recessions the economy can grow substantially faster than its long-term trend without inflation picking up. But the OBR believes that cannot happen this time because there is little spare capacity available.
The second theme of the budget is that stronger growth now means weaker growth later. Hence the need for the supply-side changes at the heart of the budget. Osborne's aim is to increase the economy's productive capacity so that it grows faster without inflation becoming a problem. Three years ago he promised a "march of the makers" but failed to deliver. Investment, exports and manufacturing output are all a lot lower than envisaged, despite the return of growth over the past 12 months.
Theme number three was that the UK cannot forever rely on low interest rates, property bubbles and equity withdrawal and must have better balanced growth. This is true, although somewhat hard to square with policies such as Help to Buy, which push up the cost of houses.

Osborne sought to put flesh on the bones of his new march of the makers trope with help for business â budget theme number four. Export credit was increased and made cheaper, investment allowances doubled and the tax break extended until the end of 2015, and energy costs were reduced. Put simply, what business wanted, business got. And then a bit more. John Cridland, director-general of the CBI, said he could not think of a single thing to criticise in the budget.
The same could not be said of Ed Miliband. Labour's leader said this was not a budget for the millions of people who had seen their living standards fall steadily throughout this parliament; the Treasury's budget ready reckoner confirms this. The increases in the personal allowance in 2014 and 2015 will each cost the exchequer just over £1bn. Freezing excise duties and shaving a penny off the cost of a pint will together amount to £300m in lost revenue, small beer in the context of a £1.5tn economy.
Osborne's fifth and final theme was a shakeup of savings and pensions. The fact that this was a cost-free package was instructive. Rising living standards for the elderly ultimately rely not on government tax breaks but on a thriving, sustainable, balanced economy. Osborne has promised that in every one of his five budgets since 2010. The wait goes on.
