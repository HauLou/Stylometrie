Torrential rain and widespread flooding did nothing to dampen the enthusiasm of Britons to shop till they dropped last month. Retail sales smashed expectations, rising more than three times as fast as the City had forecast.
February's 1.7% increase followed a 2% drop in January, so there is an element of bounce-back in the latest data from the All that said, retail sales growth is still strong. It is easier to pick up the trend by looking at the volume of sales in the latest three months rather than focusing on the February report on its own. On that basis, sales in the three months to February were 1.6% up on the three months ending in November â the fastest rate of growth since August 2013.
There are two possible explanations for what is happening. The benign explanation is that consumers are exploiting structural changes in retailing â primarily the growth of online shopping â to make their money go further. The fact that the annual rate of retail sales inflation was -0.2% in February supports this theory. With consumers confident that the economy is on the mend, they are content to run down their savings to fund purchases.
But some analysts now have a different take on the retail sales data, namely that both the pickup in spending and the recovery in the housing market are the result of interest rates being too low for too long. Official borrowing costs have been at 0.5% for more than five years and the Bank of England has signalled that they will remain unchanged for another 12 months. Threadneedle Street says the policy is working, but some in the financial markets think it is working rather too well and have brought forward the date at which they expect rates to rise.
