Is deflation in 
Tokyo's 
That's an impressive performance, even though the Nikkei has still lost more than half its value since its peak at the end of the 1990s. But two lost decades and innumerable policy errors later, there is now hope that the anti-deflationary package dubbed "Abenomics" has finally done the trick.

It is a bit early to claim final victory. The main reason the headline consumer price index was 1.2% higher in November than a year earlier was that the yen has fallen by 40% since late 2011, raising the cost of imports.

While a weaker currency was a central aim of Abenomics, it is noteworthy that core inflation â which strips out movements in food and energy prices and is much less sensitive to the level of the yen â rose by 0.6% in the year to November. That suggests the economy could easily slide back into deflation.

There are two significant risks looming in 2014. The bigger of the two is the planned increase in consumption tax in April, which is deemed necessary to tackle a budget deficit in excess of 200% of national output. In the short run, consumer spending will be strong as households race to get their purchases in before the tax hike, but there is the chance the economy could "hit the wall" in the spring.

The second threat comes from the global economy. In the past, any slowdown in the rest of the world has tended to result in investment flowing into the yen, pushing up the value of the Japanese currency, thus reducing import prices and adding to deflationary pressure. At present, this looks unlikely but events since the financial crisis began in the summer or 2007 have taught policy makers to expect the unexpected.

What all this means is that Shinzo Abe's government will be taking no chances in the months ahead. There will be additional quantitative easing in an attempt to keep the yen low and extra spending on public works to ensure that growth does not slacken and that inflation continues to rise towards its 2% target.
