There are good reasons for expecting Britain's growth rate to slow down as 2013 draws to a close but the storm that has battered the south of England in the past 24 hours is not one of them.
To be sure, a complete shutdown of the country would have an impact on national output, as was illustrated by the blizzards in December 2010.
They had a material impact on gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of that year because the disruption was widespread and protracted.
But that's not going to be the case this time. Firstly, the storm passed quickly and the Met Office gave plenty of warning that the bad weather was coming so people planned to work from home. Secondly, many workers were off anyway because of school half-term holidays. Thirdly, many of those who had an unexpected day off will have spent money in shops and restaurants. Finally, the fact that the bad weather came in October â the first month of the fourth quarter of 2013 â means there will be plenty of time to make up for lost output.
There will have been some loss of output as a result of the bad weather, but at the most it will have shaved 0.1 points off GDP in the fourth quarter, and probably less than that.
Two other factors are likely to have a bigger impact. The first is the slowdown in the global economy, with the political impasse in the United States and the weaker growth in India and China putting the brake on export growth. The second is evidence from the CBI's distributive trades survey that consumers paused for breath in October after spending freely in the previous three months.
With real incomes under pressure due to prices rising more rapidly than wages, it was to be expected that households would at some point exercise some caution. Consumers are probably holding back now in order to be able to have a splurge at Christmas. But at this early stage, growth may struggle to match the 0.8% expansion seen in the third quarter.
