The Carney stressed that the Bank could deal with the threat of a house-price bubble without the need for dearer borrowing and that there was no guarantee its nine-strong monetary policy committee would raise rates even when unemployment fell to 7%, the level at which an increase in the cost of borrowing will first be discussed under the governor's forward guidance plan.
The Bank's new forecasts suggest that the jobless rate will hit the 7% threshold in the final three months of next year, rather than early 2016, raising the prospect of the MPC discussing an increase in interest rates from their historic low of 0.5% during the highly charged months leading up to the general election of 2015.
But Carney said: "It is important to remember that the unemployment threshold is a staging post for assessing policy, not a trigger for an automatic increase in Bank rate. When the threshold is reached, the MPC will set policy to balance the outlook for inflation against the need to provide continued support to the recovery in output and employment."
The Bank was eager to play down City fears that the rosier outlook for the economy would trigger an early end to the 0.5% official interest rate that has been in force since early 2009. Official data on Wednesday showed an extra 177,000 people in work in the three months to September and the unemployment rate down from 7.8% to 7.6%. Shares fell sharply, with the near 100-point drop in the FTSE 100 index the biggest one-day drop since August. But Carney said a sustainable recovery required confidence that the stimulus would be continued in the face of poor prospects for UK exporters, government austerity and the desire of households to pay down high debt levels.
"Our forward guidance means the MPC will not even consider raising Bank rate, at least until the unemployment rate reaches 7%. Through that guidance, we are giving businesses and households the confidence that interest rates won't go up until jobs, incomes and spending are recovering at a sustainable pace."
Carney said that without the Bank's forward guidance there would already be pressure from the City for policy to be tightened. "With the recovery taking hold, our task now is to secure it. The Bank will remain vigilant to risks to financial stability from the housing sector, in particular from rapid increases in house prices and household leverage. We have a direct line of sight on the housing market across all of our responsibilities, and any potential risks will in the first instance be addressed by the financial policy committee."
Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, welcomed the Bank's forecasts showing that the economy is on course to grow by more than 3% next year, but said that there was no recovery for millions of families.
"As the governor is rightly warning, prices are still rising faster than wages and new figures today show working people are on average £1,600 a year worse off since David Cameron came to office."
While ministers will be hoping that the Bank can avoid raising rates this side of polling day, the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, said they would eventually have to rise. "I really don't think it helps for me to start trying to second-guess how interest rates may or may not be set in the future. All I would say is that interest rates are at an unprecedentedly low level because of the unprecedented economic challenges the country has faced. We are going through abnormal times and so interest rates have been set at very unusually low levels."
The Office for National Statistics said unemployment using the internationally agreed labour force survey measure fell by 48,000 to 2.47 million in the three months to September. But the official data showed cost pressures from the labour market are still abating despite the increased availability of jobs. The ONS said average earnings in the quarter ending September were 0.7% higher than in the same period of 2012 â a 0.1 point drop compared with the three months ending in August 2013.

Mark Carney, the first non-Briton to head the Bank of England, has confirmed that he plans to become a British citizen. The Canadian told Channel 4 News that he would take up British citizenship when he meets the residency requirement near the end of his term as governor. The term is usually eight years, but the chancellor, George Osborne, told parliament Carney indicated he intended to serve for five years and to stand down at the end of June 2018.
Carney has been married to his British wife for 18 years. He has also held Irish citizenship since 1988, when he started working for Goldman Sachs in London, according to the Financial Times.
