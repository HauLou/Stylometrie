It is like the run-up to a general election in So, according to There are three things worth noting here. The first is that all the calculations are based on assumptions about what will happen to the Scottish economy over the next few years. Attempts to put a monetary value on these projections are spurious, and deep down voters know it.
The second point is that, in these circumstances, impartial evidence from experts without a dog in the fight matters. So step forward the The IFS analysis is not helpful to the yes camp. It suggests Salmond is too optimistic about future oil and gas revenues, and that even if he is right about them, there is no guarantee that the public finances of an independent Scotland would be sustainable over the long term. That's because of the pressures of an ageing population and the fact that oil and gas reserves are being depleted.
The IFS raises two additional points. Salmond assumes that Scotland's fiscal position will improve because it will enjoy faster economic expansion, productivity and population growth than has been the case for the UK in recent times. Planning on this basis, according to the IFS, "seems less than cautious". What's more, the yes camp is assuming that if productivity does improve, there will be no parallel increase in real public spending per head. Yet, there has been no trend in the UK in recent times for public spending to fall as a share of national income.
The final point is that all this stuff only really counts if the referendum comes down to money. Bread and butter issues tend to matter in elections. But if the issue is national identity, Salmond could still win even if he loses the economic argument.
