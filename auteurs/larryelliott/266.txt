decision to sell its farms business to the Wellcome Trust marks the end of an era.
The Co-op has been growing seasonal produce on its own land for almost 120 years. Many of its members will find the deal hard to stomach, even though the idea of a seamless supply chain from ploughed field to dinner plate has always been a bit of a myth. Only 2% of the food produced on Co-op land is sold in Co-op stores.
Three other things are worthy of note about the deal.
The first is that, on the face of it, the Co-op looks to have got a good price for its farms business.
Prime UK farmland is changing hands for £21,500 a hectare, which would value the Co-op's 7,000 hectares at £150m, considerably less than the £249m Wellcome paid.
While no doubt the Co-op will say that it has achieved a good price on the sale, this is yet another disposal that diminishes the group.
The deal comes less than a month after the Co-op's pharmacy business was offloaded to cash-and-carry company Bestway for £620m.
Secondly, the Co-op might have got even more for its assets had it not been particularly choosy about who it sold to. There would have been plenty of potential foreign buyers attracted by the near 300% rise in the price of prime farmland in the past 10 years but the Co-op sought buyers with the same sort of values as its own. It deserves to be commended for that.
Finally, given the scale of the Co-op's losses, it didn't have an awful lot of choice. Most of the £2.5bn loss last year was the result of the grotesque mismanagement of its banking arm, and this had to be covered by the group.
Writing down the value of the Somerfield food chain by £226m contributed to what Richard Pennycook, the acting chief executive, rightly called a disastrous year. That disastrous year has led to decisions that are sad but unavoidable.
