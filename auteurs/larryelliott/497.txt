The head of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) yesterday urged diplomats to stop bickering about a mini package of liberalisation designed to boost global commerce and warned of serious damage to the 20-year-old institution if last-ditch talks failed.
Roberto Azevêdo, the WTO's new director general, expressed disappointment at the failure to conclude negotiations aimed at salvaging something from the stalled Doha Round of trade talks, now in their 13th year.
With Europe and America in talks about a transatlantic trade deal, Azevêdo believes the future of the Plans for a comprehensive deal including freer trade in agriculture, services and industrial goods have already been drastically pared back, with the WTO now trying to get agreement on a mini package involving food security, reducing customs red tape and better access to Western markets for developing countries.
Azevêdo has been pressing WTO members to complete the talks before the organisation's ministerial meeting in "It is very disappointing to be in this position today. But ... that's where we are."
Threats to an agreement have come from Washington's determination that China no longer be treated as a developing country, from Argentina's insistence on a 50% cut in agricultural export subsidies in rich countries, and from a wrangle over when poor countries should improve their customs procedures.
Azevêdo said the only option was "to make a last ditch attempt â to continue this effort and continue our work for a few more days". He said a deal had to be concluded in Geneva so that it could be rubber-stamped by ministers in Bali.
"There can be no delays â we need to start closing issues now."
