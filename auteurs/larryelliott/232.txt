George Osborne's plans to balance the government's books will require additional tax increases, spending cuts or welfare cuts worth more than £37bn in the first three years of the next parliament, according to Britain's leading experts on the public finances.
In an assessment of the budget plans of the three biggest Westminster parties, the The IFS said the biggest difference was that the Conservatives planned to secure an overall budget surplus in the next parliament, with the Treasury's tax revenues sufficient to cover both the day-to-day running costs of the government and capital spending on infrastructure projects.
Labour and the Lib Dems, by contrast, have made commitments to run a surplus on current spending but have said they would borrow in order to fund capital projects.
The thinktank said the chancellor was on course to meet his objective by 2018-19, by which time a surplus on current spending of 1.5% of national output would be greater than investment spending of 1.4% of gross domestic product.
"However, the latest forecasts for the public finances imply further deep cuts to public service spending, which have not yet been set out in any detail," the IFS said.
"To achieve the currently forecast levels of borrowing, without any further tax increases or cuts to welfare spending, the government would need to cut spending by government departments by a further 10.6% in real terms (or £37.6bn) between 2015â16 and 2018â19. This is on top of the £8.7bn cut that has already been set out for 2015â16."
The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, has yet to specify when he would start to run a current budget surplus or how big the surplus would be, saying that his decisions would depend on the state of the economy.
The IFS said the latest coalition government plans implied a current surplus of 0.5% of GDP by 2017-18, rising to 1.5% of GDP a year later.
"Unless Labour seek to deliver as large a surplus as this (or larger), their target potentially implies a looser fiscal position than current policy â that is, they may be able to cut taxes or increase spending relative to current policy by 1.5% of national income in 2018â19.
"For example, if Labour chose to achieve exactly a current budget balance in 2018â19 and allocated all the extra borrowing to easing the planned cuts to departmental spending (rather than to tax cuts or increases in benefit spending), then the cumulative cut required to departmental spending would be reduced from £37.6bn to £9.3bn between 2015-16 and 2018-19."
The Lib Dems have said their aim would be to run a surplus on the current budget adjusted to take account of the state of the economy.
"The targets chosen by Labour and the Liberal Democrats would, in principle, allow them to have a higher level of spending and/or lower level of taxation than the Conservatives would require to meet their target for borrowing", the IFS said. "However, for both Labour and the Liberal Democrats this would, of course, come at the cost of debt declining less quickly as a share of national income than implied by either current government projections or the Conservatives' fiscal target."
