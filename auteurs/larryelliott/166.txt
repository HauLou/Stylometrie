Itâs funny how history repeats itself. The inconclusive general election in 2010 took place when the economy appeared to be on the mend and against the backdrop of a crisis in the eurozone prompted by Be in no doubt, whatâs happening in Stronger support for Ukip will encourage the Conservatives to adopt a more Eurosceptic approach, hardening their stance on the concessions required for them to continue supporting Britainâs membership of the EU. Meanwhile, a permanently weak eurozone economy will push Britainâs trade balance into the red. The economic debate in the current parliament has been about sorting out the budget deficit; the debate in the next parliament will also be about sorting out the current account deficit.
Letâs start with Greece, which was where the eurozone crisis began all those years ago. The French statesman Talleyrand once said of the Bourbons that they had learned nothing and forgotten nothing. The same applies to the bunch of incompetents in Brussels, Berlin and Frankfurt responsible for pushing Greece towards economic and political meltdown.
Greeceâs recent economic performance has been pretty good. The economy is growing, unemployment is on the decline and the debt to GDP ratio has come down a bit. Time, you might think, to cut Athens a bit of slack. Not if you are the German government, the European commission or the But the Greeks have had a bellyful of austerity. They have had enough of being pushed around. Predictably, support for the anti-austerity Syriza party is strong and the mood is angry. In an attempt to regain the initiative, the government in Athens brought forward the dates for the votes in parliament to elect a new president. If by the time of the third vote at the end of the December, the centre rightâs candidate Stavros Dimas, a former EU commissioner, has not secured 180 votes out of 300 â unlikely as things stand â there will be an election that Syriza could win.
The chances of it doing so will certainly be enhanced unless the Bourbon-in-chief, Jean-Claude Juncker, learns when to keep his mouth shut. By saying he wanted âknown facesâ rather than âextremist forcesâ in charge in Greece, the European commission president was the perfect recruiting sergeant for Syriza.
The gamble seems to be that Syriza, assuming that there is an election in which it emerges victorious, will either do a U-turn on austerity voluntarily or be forced to do a U-turn due to hostile market reaction. The collapse of a Syriza government will herald the return of a centre-right government who will do what Juncker and Angela Merkel tell them to do.
But this has not been properly thought through. A crisis in Greece will take months to unfold. Bond yields will rise in every eurozone country seen as vulnerable: Portugal, Spain, Italy and, perhaps, Belgium. Business and consumer confidence will be hit. Concerns about the non-performing loans held by Europeâs shaky banks will be reignited.
This might not matter so much if this were the Europe of the 1950s and 1960s, which enjoyed rapid rates of growth and full employment. The Europe of 2014 is not like that: it has barely any growth, double-digit unemployment, is on the cusp of deflation, and â above all â is saddled with a currency that doesnât work.
Monetary union is a textbook case of the dangers of allowing politics to trump economics. Germany is a completely different economy to Greece. Portugalâs economy is not a bit like that of the Netherlands. Italy was able to remain competitive in the pre-euro days only by regular devaluations of the lira. To yoke all these countries together in a one-size-fits-all single currency was an act of supreme folly.
A fresh Greek crisis will have spillover effects. It will lead to a fresh recession and deepen deflation. Weak growth and falling prices are a toxic combination for highly indebted countries, because they raise the real value of debts while cutting national output.
Beppe Grillo of Italyâs Five Star Movement has said. âEventually will come a time when a politician will hold up a copy of the EMU [European Monetary Union] treaty, declare it null and void, and the debt null and void right along with it. That politician will be elected.â
And the moment that politician will be elected may not be all that far away. The only conceivable way to solve some â if not all â of the design flaws in the euro is for a strategy that involves debt forgiveness, expansionary policies in the countries â such as Germany â that can afford it, a large-scale quantitative easing programme from the European Central Bank and much more aggressive attempts to rid the banks of their toxic assets.
Unfortunately, this is not on the table. Eventually, once the crisis is raging, the ECB may well overcome Germanyâs misgivings about buying sovereign bonds and dip its toe in the water with a limited QE programme. It will be too little too late, and in any case contingent on further so-called structural reforms, shorthand for wage cuts and the dilution of labour rights.
So how will events unfolding in the eurozone affect Britain? Weaker demand in the eurozone will shave a percentage point or two off growth in the next couple of quarters unless manufacturers can quickly find new customers in the rest of the world. Beyond the election, any attempts to rebalance the economy towards exports are bound to be affected by the lack of growth in the market that takes more than 40% of the goods sold by the UK overseas. Itâs not great news to have the eurozone in permanent depression when you have a visible trade deficit running at around £100bn a year.
Britain is also importing more people from the eurozone than it is exporting. Inward migration is only to be expected given the difference in growth and unemployment rates: London is full of Polish, French, Italian and Spanish professionals looking for the job opportunities they canât find in their own countries.
The politics of this are simple. Voters no longer see Europe as the solution to Britainâs economic problems. They are glad Britain didnât join the euro. Many are unconvinced that Britain should be in the EU at all. The longer the euro crisis goes on, the bigger Nigel Farageâs grin will get.
