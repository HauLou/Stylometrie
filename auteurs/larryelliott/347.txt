It was dodgy accounting that got When the government in Athens announced last week that it was running a surplus in its primary budget â a measure of financial health that strips out interest payments â it could only do so by recording more than â¬3bn (£2.5bn) in arrears owed to hospitals and the social security fund as assets. Without this creative accounting, there would have been a primary deficit.
Surprisingly, Brussels seems to be aiding and abetting this sleight of hand. The But the small print shows this: Greece's overall budget deficit in 2013 was â¬23bn, of which just â¬7.2bn was interest payments. That makes for a primary deficit of almost â¬16bn. Only if you exclude the cost of one-off support to the banking sector, worth 9.5% of national output, and transfers from the rest of the eurozone equivalent to 1.5% of GDP (from profits on Greek government bonds), does it become a primary surplus of 0.8% of GDP.
The fact that this methodology is used solely for Greece speaks volumes. The country's finances are being portrayed as a success story, yet the reality is that its economy has shrunk by 23%, domestic demand has shrivelled in the face of wage cuts and austerity, and a national debt worth 170% of GDP will eventually require an amnesty or a third bailout. Some success.
