Households in Britain have seen their living standards stagnate for the past four years and are spending an increasing share of their incomes on "essentials" such as fuel and housing.
The Office for National Statistics says households' true disposable income has flatlined since the end of the recession, in the autumn of 2009, even though national output has expanded by 4.2% over the same period.
In a report likely to intensify the political row over energy prices, the ONS says the proportion of household income accounted for by essentials rose from 19.9% in 2003 to 27.3% a decade later.
"The proportion accounted for by gas and electricity has risen from 1.8% in 2003 to 3.1% in 2013, despite very little overall change in the volume of household energy consumption," the ONS says.
It adds that the weakness of real income growth â a measure of how much households have to spend once inflation is taken into account â has put pressure on budgets and limited the extent to which consumers can support growth by spending more.
"Household budgets have been squeezed by recent increases in the price of household goods," the ONS said in its economic review, adding that demand for gas and electricity did not go down when prices went up. "As a result, the recent increases in the cost of energy have taken a larger share of disposable incomes."
The ONS said recent movements in real household disposable income had followed the pattern of the recessions and recoveries in the early 1980s and early 1990s. In each case, an initial sharp drop in national output was not matched by a similar-sized fall in living standards because there was a lag before unemployment rose, cuts in borrowing costs helped mortgage payers, and increased welfare benefits helped stabilise the economy.
As the economy subsequently recovered, household living standards rose more slowly than gross domestic product.
