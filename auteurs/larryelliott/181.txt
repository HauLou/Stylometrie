A â¬300bn (£240bn)plan to revive the eurozone economy. A blueprint that will use investment in infrastructure projects to kickstart growth. A Brussels fightback against the austerity obsession that has left Thatâs not to decry the efforts of The first drawback with the Juncker plan is that there is only â¬20bn of new money, with the rest coming from the private sector.

Some critics have already dubbed this highly leveraged scheme as Junckerâs version of subprime mortgage debt.
In reality, Brussels has had little alternative but to provide seed-corn cash and hope it will generate private sector involvement. Between them Britain and The second drawback is that the investment â even assuming it happens â will take time to arrive. Every EU country has sent in a list of pet projects and these will have to be assessed by a panel of experts before a final list can be drawn up. This is a recipe for bureaucratic delay and the customary horse-trading as each country demands its share of the action. It is unlikely work will begin on a single project until 2016, when what Europe needs is an immediate boost to demand.
That could come in three ways. It could come from a more meaningful push from the centre, perhaps through the European Investment Bank. It could come from nation states if they were given more budgetary leeway by Brussels to run bigger deficits until growth has returned. And it could come from the European Central Bank through a quantitative easing process. The latter is by far the most likely and will dwarf in size what the commission has just announced.
But credit to Juncker. At a time when the Germans appear to be in total denial, he at least recognises just how bad things are.
