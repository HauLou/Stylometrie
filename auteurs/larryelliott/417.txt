Plunging share prices and currency turbulence are being caused by the go-it-alone approach of rich and developing countries, a senior In what will be seen as an implicit criticism of the US Federal Reserve, Andy Haldane, the bank's executive director for financial stability, said the lack of co-ordination reflected a failure to learn the lessons of the crash of 2007-09.
"Individual countries act in their own best interests without taking into account the broader best interest of the financial system as a whole," said Haldane, amid concerns the sharp sell-off in markets this year marks a new phase in the crisis.
The FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares closed down for the 10th day out of the last 11 trading sessions following a drop of more than 4% in Japan's benchmark stockmarket index overnight. Wall Street opened on a brighter note in the wake of a drop of more than 300 points on Monday, with the Dow Jones up by almost 100 points by lunchtime in New York.
"What is going on with the head-to-head combat is people pursuing policies of individual countries," Haldane said in a speech at the University of Oxford. "What is at stake is the system as a whole."
His remarks chime with criticisms made by India's central bank governor, Raghuram Rajan, last week. "International monetary co-operation has broken down," Rajan told Bloomberg TV India. "Industrial countries have to play a part in restoring that, and they can't at this point wash their hands off and say we'll do what we need to and you do the adjustment."
