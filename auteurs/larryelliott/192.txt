The A word of advice: read the small print. Summits invariably promise more than they deliver; commitments made in communiqués are forgotten as soon as leaders have jetted out of the country. A quick look at the document pieced together in Brisbane suggests it is the familiar wishlist of pledges, most of which will not be met.
Did the G20 sign up to numerical targets for cutting carbon emissions? No it did not. Did it put extra money on the table for tackling Ebola? No. Is it expecting the private sector to produce most of the money for infrastructure projects? Yes. Is the action against tax evasion weakened by the failure to make registers of beneficial ownership open to public scrutiny? Most definitely. Is the G20 complacent in thinking that it has fixed the banks? Almost certainly.
The G20 is right when it says the global recovery is âslow, uneven and not delivering the jobs neededâ. The assessment that the global economy is being held back by a lack of demand is bang also on the money. Few would dispute the conclusion that there are both financial and geopolitical risks out there. It was something of a triumph for Barack Obama to get climate change in the communiqué at all given the opposition of Tony Abbott, the summitâs host. Whatâs clear is that the world is at a critical juncture. Whatâs not clear is whether the long drama that has been the global financial crisis will end happily or with bodies littering the stage.
Act 1 was the crisis itself, a couple of months in which the near-implosion of the banks led to a 1930s-style collapse of trade and industrial production.
Act 2 was the co-ordinated response by an international community fearful of a second Great Depression. Interest rates were cut, money was created, public spending rose, taxes were cut. This period covered the inaugural gathering of the G20 in Washington in November 2008 and its second meeting in London the following April.
In act 3, growth started to recover and the united front cracked. Some countries wanted to start removing some of the stimulus as soon as possible. Others wanted to wait until they were sure the pick-up was for real. In the end, the G20 countries went their own way.
That proved to be a useful experiment. China had the biggest stimulus package, spending heavily on infrastructure projects and expanding credit. Of the advanced countries, the US made jobs and growth a higher priority than reducing the budget deficit. The eurozone was keener to start raising interest rates and decided that action to reduce budget deficits should begin without delay. The UK fell somewhere in between; the coalition government that arrived in power in 2010 expected the Bank of England to provide the support for growth through record low interest rates and money creation while the Treasury took the axe to the deficit.
In act 4, the results of the experiment came in. Compared to previous recoveries, the one after the global financial crisis has been weak, particularly given the unprecedented amount of support that has been provided by central banks and finance ministries. China recovered fastest and Beijing has now started to choke off some of the excesses caused by its aggressive anti-slump measures. Washingtonâs decision to put growth ahead of deficit reduction paid off: the US economy is growing at 3% a year while the deficit is down from 10% of GDP to 4% of GDP.
The eurozoneâs approach was a disaster. A misplaced concern about inflation and an obsession with balancing budgets have resulted in a prolonged period of weak growth, entrenched high unemployment and low inflation. Policy blunders have allowed a crisis that initially affected only small countries on the periphery of the eurozone to infect the core.
Britain has fallen somewhere between the US and the eurozone. UK policy in 2010 looked quite similar to that in the eurozone but became less like that on the other side of the Channel as time wore on. The Bank of England showed far more imagination than the European Central Bank, with the incentives for credit expansion in the 2012 Funding for Lending scheme crucial in rekindling a dormant housing market. Meanwhile, George Osborne eased up on his deficit-reduction and debt-reduction targets. Having looked more like Europe in 2011 and 2012, the UK now looks more like the US.
Brisbane marks the start of act 5. Two endings are possible. In one, China completes the transition to lower but more balanced growth, Japan is revitalised by Abenomics, the eurozone lifted out of its torpor by ECB quantitative easing, and a non-disruptive return to more normal levels of interest rates in the US and the UK. Lower oil prices lead to stronger demand. Markets stay calm. The Middle East goes quiet. Russia decides it does not want to be an international pariah.
The past week has shown that international co-operation, while not as strong as in 2008-09, is still there. The G20 in Brisbane was one modest expression of solidarity. Perhaps more meaningful was the US-China deal on climate change, which did include quantifiable targets. Indiaâs decision to sign up to the World Trade Organisation agreement on streamlining procedures for the passage of goods across national borders kept hopes of a multilateral trade agreement alive.
In the other, a heavy price is paid for attempting to muddle through. The second leg of the crisis begins in the Far East, with Japan using aggressive QE to drive down the value of the yen. This makes Japanese goods cheaper on global markets. China responds by driving down the value of its currency. A new wave of deflation is exported to the rest of the global economy, with particularly grievous consequences for Europe. Falling prices make debt servicing more expensive and the number of defaults increases. Hedge funds collapse and there are fears for the banks. It emerges that the G20 plan for ensuring that systemically-important banks are not âtoo big to failâ only works in individual cases not when there is a generalised panic. With policymakers wondering what they have left in the locker, Vladimir Putin decides it is the time to cut up rough over Ukraine. Act 5 ends not with the players waking up to find the crisis was all a bad dream but instead with Shakespeareâs most famous stage direction: exit pursued by a bear.
