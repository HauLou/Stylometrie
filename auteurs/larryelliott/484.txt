Compare and contrast. This was And this was the chancellor on the BBC Today programme on Monday as he announced a cap on the charges made by payday lenders: "The Conservative philosophy is that you want markets that work for people, and people who believe in the free market, like myself, want that free market properly regulated."
So what has changed in the last couple of months? Not much. Back in September, prices were rising more rapidly than wages, eroding living standards. That remains the case. Back in September, payday lenders were having no problems drumming up business from members of the public struggling to make ends meet. That remains the case. Back in September, someone who took out a £100 loan with Wonga would have to pay back £137.15 after a month. Usury was the name of the game then, and it remains the name of the game now.
In truth, what has happened since September is that the Conservatives have realised Miliband has struck a chord by focusing on the cost of living and the way in which markets are rigged against consumers. The opinion polls showed that Labour's pledge to freeze energy prices was popular with voters: Osborne is now playing social democratic catch-up.
In terms of political ideology, the government is all over the place: espousing a commitment to the free market on the one hand; subsidising mortgages and now intervening to cap charges on payday loans on the other. Presumably, next week's autumn statement will include measures to curb increases in domestic energy bills.
That said, the Damascene conversion on payday lending is welcome. Evidence from other countries suggests that caps work. Osborne has yet to ink in the details of his plan, but there would be a redistribution of income from lenders to borrowers if the government followed the Australian model, in which companies can charge a maximum of 20% up front and an interest rate of 4% a month.
A word of warning, however. The rise of payday lending over the past decade is linked to the squeeze on real incomes. To that extent, clamping down on the "respectable" end of the business, while praiseworthy, is only a partial solution. It attacks the symptom, not the cause, and will â for those mired in debt â drive the problem underground.
