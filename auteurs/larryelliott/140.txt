Chinese premier Li Keqiang has said China would avoid a hard landing as he shrugged off concerns about his countryâs slowing growth rate.
In his keynote address to the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, Li admitted that 2015 would be a tough year for the economy as it adjusted to a slower pace of expansion.
âChinaâs economy will face substantial further downward pressure in 2015â, the Chinese premier said as he insisted that there would be no deviation from the focus on structural reform and better-balanced growth.
âAt present, Chinaâs economy grew at 7.4% in 2014, its slowest rate since 1990, with the annual growth rate in the fourth quarter of the year just above 6%.
The slowdown is part of a deliberate strategy by Beijing to deal with the problems caused by the enormous stimulus programme introduced after the financial crisis of 2008, which saw credit expansion and large-scale investment in infrastructure.
Li said: âA financial crisis will not happen in China and China will not head for a hard landing.
In answer to a question from the WEFâs founder, Klaus Schwab, Li said that the easing of restrictions on the use of Chinaâs currency, the renminbi, would continue gradually. âInternationalisation is a long term process. China is still a developing country,â he said.
