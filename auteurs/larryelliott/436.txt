It was, to say the least, an unusual way to launch the 44th World Economic Forum. Having failed to persuade the pope to show up in person to Davos, the shindig's founder, Klaus Schwab, did the next best thing by arranging for a message from the pontiff to be read out on his behalf.

Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, says unease about the uneven distribution of benefits from growth is one of the things playing on the mind of Other concerns, according to Behravesh, are whether the recovery is for real this time, how the world will cope when central banks seek to return monetary policy to a more normal setting, and the potential time bomb from rising youth unemployment.
The annual survey of sentiment among global chief executives conducted by PwC revealed a rather different set of worries: red tape was top of the list followed by concerns that governments will fail to cope with budget deficits.
Dennis Nally, PwC's chairman, said the mood was one of "fragile optimism", which just about sums up the Davos mood. Businesses no longer think the next year will be a struggle for survival, but are worried about the vulnerability of emerging markets and wonder whether they are properly equipped for an upswing in demand.
In this respect, the finding in the PwC survey that two thirds of businesses say they are having trouble finding skilled labour suggests both bad planning and a logical disconnect. The bad planning is that firms have failed to invest in human capital over the past five years. The logical disconnect is that nurturing human capital starts at school, and decent education costs money. It would help if businesses paid a bit more tax.
