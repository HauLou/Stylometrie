is within a month of a period of deflation. When the figures for March come out next month cheaper energy bills will mean that the cost of living is lower than it was a year earlier.
These are uncharted waters for the UK, at least in the modern era. There have been times when inflation has turned negative but the last time prices were falling was in 1960, the year John F Kennedy became president of the US, and that was on the old RPI measure. This is a record low since the move to using the consumer prices index as the preferred yardstick of inflation.
The general assumption is that this is good news all round, even though some people do better out of zero inflation than others. Pensioners benefit because the triple lock means that the state pension is uprated by whichever is highest of the annual inflation rate, average earnings or 2.5%. At present it is 2.5%.
There are two reasons economists think zero inflation is a good thing. The first is the boost to living standards from wages rising faster than prices. Wages have risen extremely slowly since the recession of 2008-09 and even against a backdrop of falling unemployment are currently only going up by 1.6% a year.

But the drop in oil prices last year has pushed inflation lower and meant those modest wage increases now stretch further. This is clearly welcome news for the government, eager to fend off Labourâs accusation that the coalition has presided over a cost-of-living crisis. The opposition says the recent increase in living standards does not make up for earlier falls.
The second boost to consumers comes from the outlook for interest rates. It will come as no surprise to the That said, the Bank is not going to be in a hurry to raise rates either. All nine members of the Bankâs monetary policy committee are in favour of official interest rates remaining at 0.5%, which is where they have been since early 2009. They look like remaining there for the rest of this year, and one MPC member â Andy Haldane, the Bankâs chief economist â says he can contemplate voting to cut borrowing costs.
Thatâs because thereâs a potential dark side to the fall in inflation, the risk that it becomes a permanent feature of the economic landscape. The reason the majority of economists view Februaryâs zero inflation as benign is because they think lower unemployment will put upward pressure on wage settlements. Higher pay deals will start to push up inflation at a time when last yearâs drop in oil prices starts to unwind. There is, on this view, little prospect of deflation becoming embedded, as it did in Japan.
This, though, assumes that wage settlements are not dragged lower by the drop in inflation. The fact that average earnings are growing at an annual rate of below 2% even after two years of a relatively robust period of growth is indicative of a labour market where employers are able to secure workers cheaply. They may be tempted to be even less generous once inflation goes negative.
