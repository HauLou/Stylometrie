It's all a far cry from the middle of the last century, when in the 1951 general election 97% of the votes went to Labour and the Conservatives.
The reason for the anger, apathy and disillusionment is quite simple. Parties have always competed to offer the basics of life. Vote for us, they have said, and we can provide you with a decent job that will guarantee rising living standards, a roof over your head and better public services. Voters used to believe that parties could deliver on this offer. Now they don't. Or, perhaps more accurately, far fewer do.
Labour, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats all come up with variations on the basic jobs-houses-public services formula. Unemployment hit 3 million twice under the Thatcher-Major governments of 1979 to 1997, but real wages rose for those in work. Right to buy led to an expansion of owner occupation, and inflation-adjusted spending on the NHS increased by 3% a year on average.
For a time, Tony Blair pulled off the same trick. In the early 2000s, the labour market was tight after a decade of growth. Unemployment fell and real incomes grew. Activity in the housing market was strong. The taxes flowing into the Treasury were recycled into the biggest increases in NHS spending since its inception in 1948.
This was, however, a last hurrah. Real wages were starting to grow more slowly, in line with the US experience. The housing boom was only possible because of a buildup in household debt. Higher public spending was only affordable provided the City did not blow up the economy.
Things look rather different in 2014 than they did a decade ago.
On the face of it, the labour market is in reasonable shape. Employment is going up and the jobless total is coming down. Britain has an unemployment rate of around half the eurozone average.
But the old relationship between jobs and wages appears to have broken down. Traditionally, the creation of more than 500,000 jobs in a year would have resulted in greater bargaining power for people selling their labour, but wages are still struggling to keep pace with inflation.
In part, this is the result of the squeeze on private sector pay. A bigger factor though appears to be the casualisation of the British workforce â more zero-hour contracts, a large number of people working fewer hours than they would like to, and a sharp increase in the number of people scratching a living in self-employment. Work for many is infrequent, insecure and inadequately paid.
Insecurity is felt most keenly by those at the bottom of the pile. But other groups of workers â in the public sector, in middle management, in the professions â are also finding life tougher. Their jobs are at risk and it is getting harder to get a pay rise.
The dynamics of the housing market have also changed. The past decade saw the first fall in owner-occupation in modern times, as young people, already weighed down by student debt and low wages, find it impossible to get on the housing ladder. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that owner-occupation levels fell from 69% in 2001 to 64% in 2011. Housebuilding, meanwhile, has fallen to its lowest peacetime level since the 1920s. As a result, the number of people renting from private landlords has gone up, and so has the number of young people living with their parents. With the population rising as a result of net immigration, it is easy to see why housing is such a sensitive political issue.
Finally, there's public services. Here, the deal used to be that the fruits of growth would be divvied up three ways â a chunk to labour in the form of higher wages, a chunk to employers for dividends and re-investment and a chunk to the state to improve schools, hospital, roads, libraries and cradle-to-grave welfare.
This, though, relied on levels of sustained growth strong enough to deliver rising incomes and on the ability of the exchequer to collect the taxes that were due. The grand bargain breaks down if large numbers of people are on poverty wages that have to be topped up by the state, and if rich individuals and companies don't pay their dues. The tax expert Richard Murphy has estimated that HM Revenue & Customs is losing upwards of £40bn a year because it is failing to collect VAT, national insurance and income tax from companies that are trading in the UK but not completing tax returns.
The government announces a fresh crackdown on tax avoidance in every budget but has yet to solve the problem. It can no longer rely on the City and the housing market to deliver the tax revenues they did in the boom conditions of the mid-2000s. So it has a choice â borrow or squeeze. It has chosen to squeeze. The NHS has gone from feast to famine, from the most generous settlements in its history to the most niggardly, and that's even with the health budget ringfenced.
Lay it out in these terms and it becomes easier to see why voters are politically disenchanted, but there's an added twist. The basic postwar settlement was about controls and protection. It involved using curbs on capital so that governments could pursue domestic economic objectives such as full employment. It meant trade barriers to protect manufacturing. And it required controls on lending and borrowing to prevent housing bubbles.
There were benefits when this model was swept away. There were no mortgage queues, no £50 limits for foreign holidaymakers, more choice in the shops. But there was also a cost, which was that in this shiny new globalised world, governments found they had far fewer levers to pull and that the ones they did retain were less effective than before.
So, despite the Conservatives subsidising mortgages through Help to Buy and Labour promising to tackle zero-hours contracts, the message many voters have been getting is that any problems they might be having are their own fault. Unsurprisingly, they reject the idea that they are too lazy or too stupid to cut it in the new modern economy and have come up with their own reasons for why life is a struggle â too much meddling from Brussels and too many immigrants.
Changing the mood requires politicians once again to come up with policies to make capitalism meet the needs of the people, rather than policies to make the people meet the needs of capitalism. At present, the sales pitch sucks.
