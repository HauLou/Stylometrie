So much for the post-election boost to the economy. The latest evidence from the service sector â which accounts for almost 80% of national output â is that the pace of growth slackened quite sharply in May.
The response from the City was that while disappointing, the Cips/Markit survey was a blip. The economy has had a bit of a growth pause but will start to accelerate again in the second half of the year.

Consensus opinion could prove right. There are, though, reasons to be just a little cautious. The first is that external demand for UK services has weakened, largely because the biggest export market âthe US â has struggled in 2015 so far. There are plenty of other potential flashpoints, Greece most obviously.
The second is that there are the first hints of prices starting to pick up. Unless the growth in earnings picks up, the boost to living standards provided by last yearâs plunge in oil prices will be eroded.
Finally, thereâs the possible impact of George Osborneâs summer budget, in which the chancellor will outline his plans for cuts in Whitehall spending and social security spending. These will be bunched into the first half of the current parliament in the hope that the brakes can come off well before the 2020 election.
This might make political sense, but as the OECD notes in its latest economic outlook, âevening out the profile of fiscal consolidation would lower its impact on growthâ.
Turned into English, what that means is that the Paris-based thinktank believes the UK would be better served by a steady approach to deficit reduction. The risk is that the chancellor will be too aggressive, as he was in 2010.
