The westâs leading thinktank has urged wealthier countries to step up and help the worldâs poorest, after revealing that aid to the most impoverished nations fell by a sixth in 2014.
An annual assessment of overseas development assistance from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris found that aid to the least developed nations stood at $25bn (£16.7bn) last year â a 16% drop from 2013.
âOverseas development assistance remains crucial for the poorest countries and we must reverse the trend of declining aidâ, said Erik Solheim, the chair of the OECDâs development assistance committee.
 âOECD ministers recently committed to provide more development assistance to the countries most in need. Now we must make sure we deliver on that commitment.â 
The Even excluding debt relief, however, financial assistance to the least-developed countries fell in 2014, the OECD said. The OECD said the small rise in inflation between 2013 and 2014 also meant aid flows had fallen by 0.5% in real terms. 
The OECDâs secretary general, Angel Gurría, said: âI am encouraged to see that development aid remains at a historic high at a time when donor countries are still emerging from the toughest economic crisis of our lifetime.
âOur challenge as we finalise post-2015 development goals this year will be to find ways to get more of this aid to the countries that need it most and to ensure we are getting as much as we can out of every dollar spent.â
Britain was one of five of the 28 members of the OECDâs development assistance committee that met or exceeded the UN target for spending 0.7% of national income on aid. Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden were the others.
The OECD said development assistance made up more than two-thirds of external finance for the poorest countries, and that it would use an international conference of financing for development in Addis Ababa in July to call for more aid to be used as a lever to generate private investment and domestic tax revenues in poor countries.
âOECD work on combatting tax avoidance and illicit financial flows out of least-developed countries also aims to reduce dependence on aidâ, it said.
