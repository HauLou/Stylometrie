More spending cuts. A freeze on welfare benefits. A message to Google and Amazon to pay their taxes or else. This was not the speech Why? Because in normal times, parliaments have their own rhythm. Chancellors get heavy in the first couple of years, raising taxes and cutting spending so that they have a war chest to raid as polling day approaches.
Osborne is not in that fortunate position. Despite his boasts about how the deficit has been reduced by almost a half since he came to power, the programme is well off track. The deficit will be at least £50bn higher this year than it was forecast to be back in 2010. It is no longer feasible to eliminate the shortfall in one term, let alone run the budget surpluses the chancellor promised.
As a result, Osborne used his speech to announce another dose of austerity. The plans to save £25bn dwarfed the £150m tax cut that will, in the main, benefit the families of better-off pensioners.
As in the current parliament, the bulk of the savings will come from spending cuts rather than tax increases. There will be a further £13bn shaved off Whitehall budgets and they will hurt. The ring-fencing of the budgets for the NHS, overseas aid and schools means that other departments have already made all the painless cuts.
Thatâs a point made by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which has said the chancellor will also have to look to the welfare budget or to tax increases in order to plug the hole in the public finances.
Osborne does not want to raise taxes, and would certainly not be announcing plans to do so with an election looming even if he did. Instead, he announced a two-year freeze on working age benefits that will save £3.2bn a year by 2017-18. That still leaves a further £9bn to find, of which only several hundred million will come from a crackdown on multinationals diverting profits offshore.
Osborne will announce in Decemberâs autumn statement how he intends to raise the rest of the money, but believes it can be done without raising taxes.
Osborneâs task in delivering what was quite a downbeat message was helped by the hash Ed Miliband made of his speech last week. The chancellor was able to portray the Vote Conservatives for the future, not the past, he said repeatedly. He might just as well have said vote Conservative for the future no different from the past.
