Thinking about buying US dollars for your holiday in the States this year? If so, the temptation to buy now was there on Monday when the pound hit a three year high against the greenback and closed in on the $1.70 level.
Sterling slipped back later as investors took profits from the big gains seen over the past week. But it was probably just a pause for breath. There is more juice in the pound yet, but buyers beware: the rally is time-limited.
The pound has been strengthening against the dollar because the latest US economic news has been a bit iffy. While the cold weather played a part, the markets have been a tad disappointed by the jobs, consumer spending and industrial production data. Much more of it and Wall Street will start speculating about the possibility of the Federal Reserve pausing in its tapering programme â the gradual reduction in the amount of bonds bought monthly by the US central bank.
But sterling's recent rise against the dollar is part of a longer term trend in which it has risen against all major currencies over the past year. It is not hard to see why. The pound was sold off in 2012 when the economy surprised on the downside. For the past 12 months, the news from the UK has been better than expected and sterling has strengthened as a result.
What's more, despite Mark Carney's forward guidance, the financial markets have advanced the date at which they think the Bank of England will announce an interest rate rise to February next year, before they expect a move from the Fed, the ECB or the Bank of Japan.
So why should holidaymakers strike while the iron is hot? Two reasons. Recent UK growth has been a matter of quantity at the expense of quality: national output is rising because the housing market is humming and consumers are running down their savings. And a rising pound is not at all helpful when you are running a current account deficit of 5.5% of GDP. Investors will take note of that before long.
