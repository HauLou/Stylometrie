There are more buyers than sellers of the pound, so the value of sterling is going up. This is a comment on the state of the economy, a factor in determining the future path of interest rates and a familiar challenge to policymakers seeking to recast the economy.
Let's take those three points in turn. Investors buy currencies for two main reasons: they like the look of the way an economy is performing or they are attracted by the higher interest rates on offer. In the UK's case, both growth and yield are an inducement to hold the pound: the International Monetary Fund's forecast that Britain will have the strongest growth of any G7 country is likely to be confirmed by Tuesday's GDP data.
And although official interest rates have been stuck at 0.5% for more than five years, the markets believe the Bank of England will raise the cost of borrowing before any other central bank. A really strong GDP figure that leads the City to expect a much earlier increase in interest rates could send the pound through the $1.70 level against the US dollar this week.
But a stronger pound cuts the cost of imports, holding down increases in the cost of living and thus making it easier for the Bank of England to hit the government's 2% inflation target. As measured by the consumer prices index, inflation is currently running at 1.6%, making it relatively simple for the Bank to fend off calls for tighter policy.
Yet the strong pound/suppressed inflation/low interest rates nexus creates its own problems. The flipside of cheaper imports is that exports become dearer, hurting manufacturing. A low-interest-rate environment encourages borrowing and asset-price bubbles.
Let's be clear, the recent strength of the pound has yet to cause serious damage to the economy.
