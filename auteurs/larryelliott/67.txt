Cast your mind back to May 2010. George Osborne has arrived at the Treasury accusing the outgoing The plan fails. Taking the axe to infrastructure projects and raising VAT deflates the economy, which slows to a standstill after two years. Osborne quietly abandons his own plan in favour of the deficit-reduction blueprint he inherited from Alastair Darling.
Now imagine, as the The IFS doesnât say as much in its even-handed assessment of what the parties have to say about the public finances in their respective manifestos, but it clearly thinks the Conservatives are winging it. In truth, the thinktank believes everybody is winging it, but the Conservatives are winging it more than Labour, the Why? Because the Economy

There are no stealthy ways of tackling the welfare budget. Cutting £12bn from welfare means taking money away from the hardworking families the Conservatives are courting in the election campaign, which explains their reluctance to spell out what the new round of austerity actually requires. It will mean less generous child benefit, lower housing benefit for those in low-paid jobs struggling with high rents in London and cuts in incapacity benefit.
Similarly, saving £13bn from Whitehall departments, while sparing the NHS, schools and overseas aid from the axe, is going to require that the budgets of unprotected departments such as defence and the Home Office will need to be reduced by 18% in inflation-adjusted terms. The cut in the next parliament will be as big as that seen in the last parliament and will bring the cumulative reduction to a third between 2010 and 2020. With a touch of contempt, the IFS dismisses the suggestion that the Conservatives could find the find the money from efficiency savings. If they were that easy to find, the IFS notes, they would have been found by now.
So the message from the IFS is not just that the Conservative manifesto is uncosted but that it will be extremely hard to implement. What the IFS doesnât say is that if the Conservatives did manage to implement the social security and departmental spending cuts they say are in store, they would again slow down the economy so much that their deficit reduction targets would again move out of reach.
Labour has yet to make any political capital out of the fantasy-island nature of the governmentâs plans. Indeed, given the opportunity by the IFS to say that under Ed Miliband there would need to be no cuts in welfare and only the smallest reduction to departmental spending, Labour spurned it. Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, said the IFS was wrong to assume that a Labour government would stop cutting once it had balanced day-to-day spending. The plan is to run a surplus on the current budget, which will require more austerity.

The political motivation for this show of machismo is obvious, even if the economic rationale is not. As Osborne found in the last parliament, the traditional mechanism for softening the blow from austerity â cutting interest rates â is impossible when borrowing costs are already on the floor. 
But Labour has suffered reputational damage as a result of being in power during the global financial crisis of 2008-09 and wants to rebuild trust. Its problem has been accentuated during the election campaign by the Conservative claim that Labour will only be able to govern with the spendthrift SNP. Ironically, the IFS view is that the SNP is all talk, with its plans involving deeper departmental spending cuts and a longer period of austerity than Labourâs.
The gap between Labour and the SNP on deficit reduction is small, and certainly a lot smaller than the gap between Labour and the Conservatives. David Cameron says that under Labour the national debt would be £90bn higher than under the Conservatives. Thatâs only true, however, if the Conservatives manage to deliver a plan that looks undeliverable.
