Want to understand what's happening in the eurozone? Then think back to the early years of the UK's coalition government.
That was the time when the British economy was flatlining. Sure, there were periods when activity expanded. But the recovery never really gained traction and was vulnerable to unexpected shocks. Sometimes these were external â as with the eurozone's debt crisis; sometimes they were internal â as with ill-timed and excessive austerity.
The upshot was that the recovery never really got going until the Bank of England stepped in with its Now take a look at the eurozone. Here too, the economy is struggling to gain traction. Here too, it is extremely sensitive to shocks, the latest of which is the threat of a full-scale confrontation between Russia and Ukraine. Here too, there has been far too much austerity far too soon.
Result? The recovery, such as it was, has come to a standstill. Low inflation is threatening to become deflation. In one important respect, the position facing the eurozone is more parlous than that facing the UK two or three years ago. Firstly, the public finances are in even worse shape. Italy, for example, already has a national debt worth around 130% of its annual output. Zero growth plus deflation plus a lack of monetary wriggle room adds up to a real threat that debts will become unsustainable.
Secondly, the policy response in the eurozone has been inadequate. Give Similarly, the The eurozone is now at a fork in the road. Plan A - hoping that time and structural reform will do the trick - is not working. It is time for Plan B - a rethinking of austerity, a more aggressive use of the European Investment Bank to fund infrastructure projects, a fast-tracking of QE.
