has been in Brazil this week with an eye to opening up one of the world's bigger emerging markets to British exporters. Not before time, if the latest trade figures are anything to go by.
The headline news from the Office for National Statistics is that the monthly trade deficit in February narrowed a bit, down to £2.1bn from the £2.2bn in January.
But scratch beneath the surface and the reason for being less in the red was that imports fell by more than exports. As Samuel Tombs at Capital None of this suggests that there is much rebalancing of the economy going on. In essence, any benefits that might have been gained from the 30% depreciation in sterling from 2007 to 2009 has been wiped out by the stagnation in Europe, comfortably the UK's biggest export market.
The modest recovery in the eurozone since the middle of last year is likely to provide less of a boost to UK firms than might be imagined. Countries such as Spain are seeing stronger growth because savage deflation has made their exports more competitive. They are not importing much. In addition, the pound has appreciated by 10% over the past 12 months, enough to make life a bit more difficult for British exporters.
It is right for the government to be thinking about ways to break into markets growing far more rapidly than Europe is likely to do over the decades to come. But a degree of realism is required. The union jack is arriving in China, India and Brazil long after exporters from rival countries planted their flags. And Britain's big export sectors â pharmaceuticals, financial services, education â will only come into their own when the emerging economies have matured a bit more. The recovery in the UK has been domestically based; it is likely to remain so.
