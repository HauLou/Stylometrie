What's the French for humble pie? Whatever it is, Olivier Blanchard was eating a The chancellor, who was mightily cross with Blanchard's unwanted advice last year, could have been excused had he decided to gloat. Wisely, he declined to do so. In part that was because the IMF's admission that it had got it wrong spoke for itself. In part it was because Osborne knows that the IMF is right when it says the UK recovery is unbalanced and too dependent on the fillip provided by a fast-developing property boom.
What's more, the recovery over the past year has not been the result of Britain sticking to the original austerity plan â as the chancellor was insisting â but in subtle deviations from it. The Funding for Lending Scheme, Help to Buy, and a restoration of some of the cuts to the capital budget were all important in bringing two years of flat-lining to an end.
There was a final reason for Osborne to behave gracefully. Those with long political memories recall Gordon Brown reacting furiously to a prescient IMF warning about the state of the UK public finances ahead of the 2005 election. Chancellors who boast about the strength of UK recoveries â even those of longer standing than the current one â can come an awful cropper.
