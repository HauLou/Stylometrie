Marrying demand and supply in the housing market is a live issue in the UK. The number of people looking to buy a home is going up faster than new houses are being built. The result is property inflation.
But increasing housing supply is difficult. Planning laws are tough and nimbyism is rife. There is always opposition to building new developments on greenfield sites in areas where employment prospects are good.
Enter Simon Wolfson, chief executive of Next and founder of the Wolfson prize. Last year he put up £250,000 for the best explanation of how a country could leave the euro; this year he is offering the same amount of dosh for anybody who can come up with a blueprint for a new garden city.
The architect or urban planner who can take the idea pioneered by Ebenezer Howard in Letchworth a century or so ago and turn it into a solution to Britain's housing crisis will deserve the £250K.
But garden cities, attractive though they sound, will not be the answer. First, the reason that there are so few of them is that the high price of the homes in the tree-lined streets of Hertfordshire made them unaffordable to those on modest incomes.
There might be a case for a new Letchworth as part of a balanced approach to increasing housing supply, but only alongside a couple more new towns the size of Milton Keynes.
Second, builders are not interested in wasting what they see as valuable development land on homes with generous front and back gardens. They want to squeeze in as many houses on a plot as they can.
Finally, even if a way is found of re-badging a new town as a garden city that will not prevent opposition. The nimbys will still hate it.
