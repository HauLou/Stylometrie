Imagine the scene. You are So what do you do? Easy. Firstly, you dress up the failure to meet the deficit reduction as best you can, by highlighting all the economic numbers that are looking good, such as growth, inflation and unemployment. Secondly, you ram home the message that it was Labour who bequeathed the deficit in the first place, peppering your speech with references to how the economy was a virtual basket case in 2010.
But you fear thatâs not going to be enough. You need a rabbit to pull out of the hat at the end of your speech, something that has not been leaked in advance yet is guaranteed to knock the state of the deficit out of the headlines.
And what better than a reform of stamp duty that will benefit buyers of property in 98% of cases? Given the way in which Britain obsesses about bricks and mortar, changing the way stamp duty is levied pushes all the buttons. It makes sense in itself as a replacement for the current âslabâ system whereby a tiny change in the transaction price can lead to a huge increase in the tax liability. It appeals directly to aspirational voters in key seats. By raising more money from those buying expensive homes, it is a direct contrast with Labourâs mansion tax.
And it will provide a fillip to a flagging property market in the months leading up to the general election.
Sure, the focus on stamp duty sits oddly with the chancellorâs talk of rebalancing the economy towards investment and exports. Sure, the further slippage in deficit reduction will â as Osborne admitted â mean plenty of pain in the next parliament. But as a political coup, it worked.
