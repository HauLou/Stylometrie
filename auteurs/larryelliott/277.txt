The knee-jerk response to the 0.1% rise in retail sales in June is to dismiss the weaker-than-expected increase as no big deal.
That was certainly the response of the City, where analysts concentrated on the much healthier looking quarterly increase, and pointed out the special factors that held back spending last month.
There is something in this. Sales in the three months to June were 1.6% higher than in the previous quarter, and that does tend to be a better guide to the trend than data from a single month.
What's more, the summer sales have been delayed this year and consumers may simply have been holding back on spending until the bargains appear. Traditionally, there has also been a dip in spending when the World Cup is on. The City is confident that spending will bounce back in July in line with this week's distributive trades survey from the CBI.
The argument, however, that consumers are simply putting spending on hold is not 100% convincing. The quarterly jump in retail sales is almost entirely the result of the sharp increase in spending in April. Sales volumes fell in May, when neither the timing of the summer sales nor the World Cup were factors.
In addition, it's hard to imagine why the World Cup would have been that much of a factor, other than on online spending, given that most of the games took place in the mid to late evening.
Indeed, this might be one of the occasions when the one-month figures are telling us something â namely that the economy has started to come off the boil. Activity in the housing market is clearly slowing because potential buyers are unable to afford asking prices, while recent months have seen wage growth fall well below the inflation rate. In those circumstances, it would be no surprise to see consumers become a tad more cautious.
That will not prevent the second quarter growth figures due on Friday from being extremely strong. But all the signs are that this will be as good as it gets.
