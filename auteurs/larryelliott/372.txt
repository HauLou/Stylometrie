Bonuses for Britain's business leaders are falling for a third year as companies feel the need to be fair to their workforces, according to consulting group PwC. Its survey of 43 PwC said nearly a quarter of FTSE 100 companies that have reported so far have frozen their chief executive's salary and that pay increases, at less than 3%, have been largely been in line with the rest of the workforce. It added that a third of companies believe their remuneration committee's pay decisions are more focused on fairness between executives and the wider workforce because of new disclosure rules.
Median total pay, including long-term incentive payouts, increased by just 0.5% for chief executives who were in the job in both years.
PwC said its research suggested that the trend for moderate pay increases and bonus payouts would continue in the medium term, as more than half (60%) of organisations expect the overall level of senior executive pay to be within 10% of current levels over the next five years.
Tom Gosling, head of PwC's reward practice, said: "The 2014 annual meeting season is shaping up to be another year of restraint. Despite fears that executive pay inflation would take off again as the economy recovers, this doesn't seem to be the case. Executives are seeing only modest salary increases and bonuses continue to fall. Remuneration committees are approaching any increase in pay-outs with caution to ensure they accurately reflect performance and satisfy shareholders."
