Inflation in the UK is low and it is going lower. The chances of a period of falling prices has increased sharply after the Office for National Statistics said the cost of living as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) was just 0.5% higher in December than it was a year earlier. It seems the clock is being turned back to those times â long periods of the 19th century and the interwar decades â when deflation was a feature of the economic landscape.
At least for the time being. Fresh falls in the price of oil, which has been trading as low as $45 a barrel, and the weakness of producer prices (the cost of goods as they leave factories) means that it is now quite conceivable that inflation will turn negative in the next couple of months. Even so, the risk of a prolonged period of deflation still looks relatively slim.
Hereâs why. The UK is not yet in that situation. Firstly, there is, as yet, no indication that the public is expecting permanent price falls. Secondly, inflation is being pushed down by two specific factors: the collapse in the price of crude oil and the battle for market share among the big four supermarkets. Take out the impact of food and fuel and so-called core inflation actually rose a tad in December, from 1.2% to 1.3%.
A third factor is the likely response to low inflation from the Will the Bank take the same approach now that inflation is undershooting? Two members of its monetary policy committee, Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, have been taking that view because they believe borrowing costs need to rise before inflationary pressures start to build. It is though hard to imagine any of the seven other MPC members joining them in the near future.
As a result, economic activity in the next few months is going to be supported by ultra-low interest rates, more generous pay settlements and a widening gap between earnings and prices. That will eventually push up prices and ensure that deflation, if it arrives, will be modest and relatively brief.
