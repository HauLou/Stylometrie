The Conservative party line on the economy has changed in recent weeks. At budget time, the message was that the repair job was only half done and tough decisions lay ahead.
Since the election has been called, however, the language of restraint has disappeared and been replaced by promises of tax cuts and spending increases, most of them uncosted, in the next parliament. Sir Stafford Cripps, the austerity chancellor, has been placed in temporary cold storage and replaced by the famous pools winner Viv Nicholson.
David Cameron set the tone at the launch of the Conservative manifesto. The great recession had become a great recovery, the prime minister insisted, as he outlined plans to extend right to buy, offer more free childcare and exempt those on the minimum wage from paying income tax.
A great recovery? Hardly. This has been the slowest and weakest in recent history, slower even than that which followed the great depression. Despite Cameronâs boast that the government had stuck to its course, growth only started to accelerate when George Osborne abandoned his deficit reduction targets and accepted that borrowing would be higher than he originally planned.

The childcare policy will cost a further £1bn. Raising the income tax personal allowance to £12,500 carries a £6.9bn price tag, and raising the threshold at which people pay income tax to 40% costs £3.9bn.
In addition, a future Conservative government would need to compensate housing associations for the properties they will be forced to sell under its right-to-buy proposals. The precise cost of this policy is hard to assess, because it will depend on how many tenants can afford monthly mortgage payments even after the price of their homes has been discounted.
Neither Cameron nor Osborne has yet said where the money to pay the bill, in excess of £20bn a year, would be found. One option would be to borrow more, but the Tories have explicitly ruled that out, having pledged to turn a £90bn budget deficit into a surplus by the end of the next parliament.
As far as it is possible to tell, the Conservatives are saying that their plans will be financed from the proceeds of growth, but the growth of the past two years has generated much less tax revenue than expected, partly because of Britainâs low-wage economy.
Whatâs more, the party has announced that it will cut £30bn in costs over the next five years: £13bn from Whitehall departments, £12bn from welfare and £5bn from tax avoidance measures. All of this will suck money out of the economy in the first two years of the next parliament, running the risk that it will repeat its sluggish performance after the 2010 election.
In which case, the Conservatives would have a choice. Announce even deeper cuts than are currently planned, raise taxes - or tear up large chunks of their manifesto.
