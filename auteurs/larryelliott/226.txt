Itâs been the classic bad cop, good cop routine. From George Osborne on Monday, Britain received the depressing news that austerity was going to continue deep into the next parliament. More cuts were on the way, the chancellor said.
Today, it was time for the prime minister to be a bit more cheerful. Provided the deficit kept coming down, David Cameron said there would be tax cuts to come under a future Conservative government. And not just little tax cuts either.
Rabbit number one was the promise to raise the income tax personal allowance from £10,500 to £12,500 during the next parliament. The idea is to show that the Rabbit number two was for the middle-class voters the Conservatives need to woo back in order to win next yearâs election. During the course of this parliament, the number of people paying income tax at 40% has increased by an estimated two million to more than five million.
This has happened because the threshold at which the 40% rate is paid has not been increased in line with inflation. Cameron not only promised to put an end to this stealth tax affecting teachers and police officers, he pledged to raise the threshold by more than 20% â from £41,900 to £50,000.
This was a pitch for the votes of Middle England in the marginal seats the Conservatives need for victory next May.
How are these expensive tax pledges to be paid for? The prime minister made it clear that the £25bn of savings demanded by the chancellor will come entirely from spending cuts. If that means even deeper cuts in welfare payments, including tax credits, that will offset some of the benefits to the low paid of raising the personal allowance.
A second issue is whether the government is now sending out mixed messages: austerity needs to continue from Osborne; happy days are here again from Cameron.
Clearly that is a risk. But provided the economy continues to grow at a decent lick â always an important proviso â it is feasible that the next parliament will see the deficit falling faster than forecast, opening up scope for tax cuts.
Importantly, though, the prime minister did not specify exactly when the tax cuts would be delivered, other than to say they would be in the next parliament. That provides a degree of wriggle room should things not go as planned. In the meantime, Cameron has just launched the Conservative tax manifesto for May 2015.
