We donât have to wait for parliament to be dissolved. We donât need to see what the parties say in their manifestos. George Osborneâs budget marks the start of the 2015 general election campaign.
It was an upbeat speech, which began and ended with a boast about how Britain was walking tall again, and finished with talk about the âcomeback countryâ. Osborneâs message was that the job of sorting out the economy was not yet complete, and he carefully used the extra leeway he will get from falling oil prices to cut the national debt.
The budget was neutral in that the array of measures should neither boost demand nor reduce it. However, this doesnât mean there were no goodies for voters in the package. There were, but Osborne found ways of raising revenue from banks, rich pensioners and tax avoiders to pay for increasing the personal tax allowance, cutting duty on beer and whisky, reducing tax on savers and introducing help-to-buy Isas.
The chancellorâs strategy was simple: contrast his competence with the chaos that would ensue if Labour were to win the election, and show how his prudent stewardship of the public finances has allowed him to help ordinary Britons improve their lives. He was at pains to show that the economy was working for all parts of Britain.
Listening to the chancellor, it was easy to forget that his strategy has been a flop. The economy has grown much less than expected, and deficit reduction has been much slower than forecast. Borrowing this year will be £90bn, two-and-a-half times what was pencilled in five years ago.
The governmentâs failure to rein in the deficit means that cuts in public spending â and deep ones at that â will continue for the first three years of the next parliament. Tax increases are also likely.
But, for the time being, government policy is just about the next 50 days. Hereâs the reality. The economy is now growing, although not spectacularly fast. Living standards have started to rise, but only because inflation has fallen sharply as a result of the collapse in oil prices. Investment is falling and the boost to the economy from the housing market appears to be fading.
Osborne conjured up a way of showing that living standards will be higher at the end of 2015 than they were in 2010, and hopes this will negate one of Labourâs big election themes. But the chancellorâs claim assumes that real household disposable income will increase by more than 3.1% this year, which looks optimistic. 
Whatâs more, the latest opinion polls suggest that, for most voters, the idea that they are better off now than they were five years ago is highly questionable.
