The US created more than 200,000 new jobs in October as the economy shrugged off impact of the federal government shutdown.
In news that immediately prompted speculation about a winding down of Americaâs growth stimulus, the Bureau of Labor Statistics published figures showing a much better employment outlook than had been expected.
Wall Street had been prepared for an increase of 120,000 in non-farm payrolls last month amid speculation that the temporary lay offs of federal employees would offset job creation in the private sector. In the end, the BLS said the economy added 204,000 new jobs.
Despite the increase in payrolls, the unemployment rate edged up from 7.2% to 7.3%, largely as a result of the temporary furloughs. The employment rate dropped by 0.4 percentage points to 62.8%.
The BLS also revised up its estimates of jobs growth in the previous two months â from 193,000 to 238,000 in August, and from 148,000 to 163,000 in September.
Early indications were of a sharp sell off in US shares due to concerns that the increase in payrolls will bring forward the timing of the tapering of the $85bn (£53bn) a month stimulus provided by the Federal Reserveâs bond-buying programme.
The US central bank deferred a decision on tapering in September, but is likely to discuss a scaling back of so-called quantitative easing when it meets next month.
Alex Edwards, head of the corporate desk at UKForex, said: âThe data supports some views out there that the Fed will taper its quantative easing programme in December. However, the impact of the government shutdown in October reduces the reliability of the number, so we hold the view that the Fed will taper in March as opposed to December, once the Fed has seen more proof of improving labour market conditions.â
The BLS said almost half the increase in jobs came from two sectors â a 53,000 increase in the leisure and hospitality sector, and a 44,000 rise in retail employment. 
James Knightley, at ING bank, said: âThe numbers are much stronger than anyone expected â the highest forecast in the market was 175,000 for payrolls â and suggest the government shutdown had a negligible impact on the labour market. However, this goes against anecdotal evidence suggesting that with government contracts not being paid, and the general level of economic uncertainty it created, this led to firms pulling back on hiring.â
