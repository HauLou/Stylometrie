A second monthly drop in exports is fuelling financial market concerns about a slowdown in the Chinese economy.
Analysts said they were shaving their growth forecasts for the world's second biggest economy as it emerged that trade would provide much less of a boost than expected in the first quarter of 2014.
But China's premier, "We will not take, in response to momentary fluctuations in economic growth, short-term and forceful stimulus measures," Li said in a speech.
"We will instead focus more on medium- to long-term healthy development."
Li's comments followed the release of official data showing that exports fell by 6.6% in March, following an 18.1% drop in February. Imports fell by 11.3% â China's biggest decline in more than a year.
Economists were most worried by the fall in imports, which was seen as confirming weakness in manufacturing and consumer demand. Some of the fall in exports was attributed to figures early last year being inflated by fake invoices before a government crackdown around the middle of 2013.
"My bigger concern is imports. It suggests a weakening in China's own economy," said Louis Kuijs, economist at RBS in Hong Kong.
Prakash Sakpal, economist with ING, said that despite Li's remarks, he expected the Chinese government to introduce measures to ensure growth met its official 7.5% target for 2014.
While cutting ING's growth forecast for the first quarter from 7.6% to 7.3%, Sakpal added: "We are retaining our full-year GDP growth forecast at 7.5% on the view that, as occurred last year, a mini-stimulus will produce a small bounce in growth. However, we consider the risk to our forecast skewed to the downside."
