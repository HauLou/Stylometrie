World cup years are unhappy times for financial markets. So says Dario Perkins, of Lombard Street Research, who warns it is not just football fans who should be biting their nails when the biggest event in the global football calendar kicks off next month.
As Perkins describes it, the inaugural World Cup in 1930 (winners Uruguay) coincided with the start of the Great Depression. In 1990 (West Germany), the US was in recession. The bond markets were in turmoil four years later (Brazil) and 1998 (France) was the year Russia devalued the rouble and defaulted on its debt, plus the collapse of the world's biggest hedge fund, Long Term Capital Management.
The correlation is not quite perfect. The dotcom recession was over by the time the World Cup was held in Japan in 2002 (Brazil) and the stock market crash was still a year away when the tournament was hosted by Mexico in 1986 (Argentina). Even so, the parallels are close enough to ponder what could go wrong in 2014. The short answer is a currency war between the US and the At the moment, this is not seen as remotely possible. Central banks around the world are mightily hacked off with the way the This has made life uncomfortable for the Australians, the New Zealanders and the South Koreans but has had no broader implications all the time the ECB has been forced to sit on the sidelines because of the Bundesbank's opposition to quantitative easing as a way of driving down the euro.
By all accounts, Frankfurt is now up for QE, which means the ECB's president Mario Draghi can act next month against the threat of deflation. Those with long memories will recall that the 1987 stock market crash was precipitated by an exchange rate row between the US and Germany.
So could things be kicking off again when the 2014 World Cup is decided in early July? Don't bet against it.
