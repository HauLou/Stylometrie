There are limits, though. Hollande and his ministers made it clear that they were unhappy about the US company GE taking over the energy division of industrial group Alstom, dismissing the bid as "not good enough". That was even though the board of Alstom had voted for the deal to go ahead, which it probably still will once GE has agreed extra concessions on jobs.
The case illustrates a fundamental difference with the UK. In France, the default position is to oppose foreign takeovers of companies deemed strategically important unless there is a good reason for them going ahead. That is especially so if the bidder is from the US, where the legal system makes hostile takeovers from non-American companies difficult.
Over here, the authorities have only tended to stand in the way of a foreign takeover if there is a good reason for it not going ahead. In France, the bar is set high, in the UK it is set low. Which is why Pfizer must have expected its proposed takeover of Yet the mooted takeover has caused political waves. In part, that is because the transaction is so palpably about reducing Pfizer's tax bill. In part, it is because nobody really trusts Labour is solidly against the takeover.
