The prospect of another split at the Martin Weale, one of the four independent members of the Bankâs nine-strong monetary policy committee, said that despite global worries about low inflation the decision about whether to raise interest rates was finely balanced.
Weale voted for a rate rise in the closing months of 2014 along with fellow MPC member Ian McCafferty. But he changed his mind as a result of the halving of oil prices, which has left inflation as measured by the consumer price index at 0.3%.
In speech in London on Wednesday, Weale said: âCompared with the autumn, when I was voting for an increase in [the] Bank rate, the fall in oil prices has certainly provided some unexpected breathing space. It is, however, at present no more than that.â
He said there was a risk that low inflation would become entrenched, identifying the recent rise in the value of sterling as the next factor that could push the cost of living lower.
But Weale said there was also an upside threat to inflation from the labour market.
âThe unemployment rate has been falling rapidly, and we have also seen the employment rate reach a record high,â he said, adding that job vacancies were back to pre-crisis levels. 
Although growth in average earnings is running at around the 4% level seen before the deep recession of 2008-09, he said that âpay is now growing at its fastest rate since before the crisisâ.He added: âIf wage growth continues to accelerate over the next few months, especially in the absence of a pickup in productivity, then for me it strengthens the case for a rise in [the] Bank rate. As always, however, I will decide how to cast my vote in the light of economic developments.â
