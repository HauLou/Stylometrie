the European Central Bank and quantitative easing. How much? For how long? What concessions have been made to the Germans? Will it make any real difference to the enfeebled state of the eurozone?
After so many false dawns in the past, the prevailing mood is one of caution. There is very little sense among the business leaders or the policy chiefs that buying â¬50bn (£38bn) of sovereign bonds a month will do much good. Rather, the feeling is that not doing it could do even more damage to an economy already in deflation.
Why the pessimism? A number of reasons. The ECB has arrived at QE late in the day, six years after it was announced in the US and the UK. As Anne Richards, chief investment officer of Aberdeen Asset Management, pointed out, back in 2008-09 the ECB was convinced QE meant hyperinflation. It was fighting the wrong war.
A second problem is that the US acted swiftly and decisively to clean up its banking system and the eurozone did not. The Obama administration allowed US banks to get rid of their toxic assets, which meant that they were in a better position to boost lending when QE arrived. Many banks in the eurozone are still not in good shape.
This leads on to a third problem. Despite the talk of political gridlock in Washington, it only really took three people to make key decisions during the financial crisis: the president, the treasury secretary and the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Decision-making in the eurozone is a much more cumbersome process, involving endless delays and horse-trading. Draghiâs QE announcement highlights those weaknesses.
Finally, QE is not and never has been a panacea. Larry Summers, the former US treasury secretary, said it works best when there is an element of surprise and when there is scope to reduce bond yields. But the ECB has been signalling its intention to buy bonds for months, and bond yields are already very low.
Ana Botín, chief executive of Santander, noted that QE is one leg of a four-legged stool, the others being fiscal policy (tax and spending decisions), structural reform, and the transmission mechanism by which money gets from the central bank to the real economy.
Again, things do not look all that promising for the eurozone. There has been too much austerity, too little structural reform, the transmission mechanism is impaired.
So, is there any point to QE? Yes, because banks have been paying back the cheap loans to the ECB that they were granted at the height of the crisis. The ECBâs balance sheet has been shrinking for the past 18 months. Buying bonds will offset the tightening impact of that process.
In addition, the euro has dropped sharply on the foreign exchanges in anticipation of ECB action. Failure to deliver will reverse that process, making imports cheaper and adding to deflationary pressure. ECB action on Thursday will not transform the eurozoneâs economic prospects. But doing nothing would make a bad state of affairs even worse.
