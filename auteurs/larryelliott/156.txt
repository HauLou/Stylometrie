George Osborneâs hopes of using a strengthening economy as the springboard for victory in the general election next May have been dealt a double blow with news of weaker growth during 2013 and 2014 and one of the biggest current account deficits in the UKâs history.
With Britainâs recovery from its worst ever recession set to dominate a tightly fought vote next spring, Labour seized on official figures showing it was unlikely that national output would expand this year by the 3% envisaged by the chancellor in the autumn statement.
Osborne has claimed in recent weeks that a combination of stronger growth, falling unemployment and a smaller budget deficit have shown that the governmentâs plan is working and that sticking to the current course is essential.
But the With fresh figures showing Americaâs economy expanding at an annual rate of 5% in the third quarter, it will now be touch and go whether Britain is the fastest growing of the leading G7 industrial nations in 2014.
The data from the ONS added spice to the political battle over economic competence when it said gross domestic product per head â one measure of living standards â was rising, but the 0.6% increase in the third quarter left the measure 1.8% below its pre-recession peak.
An alternative measure of national wellbeing â net national disposable income â remained flat in the third quarter and was 5.6% below its pre-recession peak. The measure makes allowances for depreciation and for income generated in the UK that goes to overseas residents.
Meanwhile, the UKâs current account â which measures trade in goods and services together with investment income and payments to multinational bodies â was in the red by £27bn in the July to September quarter. At 6% of gross domestic product, the current account deficit is now higher than it was during the so-called Lawson boom at the end of the 1980s, its previous peak.
Shabana Mahmood MP, Labourâs shadow Treasury minister, said: âThese are concerning figures. Growth has been revised down for five of the last six quarters, exports continue to disappoint, and business investment fell in the last quarter. The chancellor has totally failed to rebalance the economy as he promised. And working people are still not feeling the recovery, with wages sluggish and average earnings in real terms down £1,600 a year since 2010.â
Upward revisions to Americaâs growth exceeded Wall Streetâs expectations, with the Dow Jones average pushing through 18,000 for the first time. The US economy has been growing robustly since a weather-related fall in output in the first three months of this year, and analysts believe it will expand by about 2.5% for 2014 as a whole.
On the foreign exchanges, the pound fell to its lowest level in a year against the dollar and by the close of business in London was trading at just above $1.55. Currency traders believe that stronger growth will lead to the US Federal Reserve becoming the first major central bank to raise interest rates, and were taken aback both by the UK growth figures and the current account deficit.
David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: âWhile the quarterly results remain strong, the stark revision in annual growth confirms that the pace of recovery is slowing. The most concerning aspect of these figures is that the current deficit has risen to an unsustainably high level â due to the fall in net investment. Although the economy continues to grow, the recovery is not yet secure, and further efforts are needed to boost business investment and to help businesses export to foreign markets.â
An ONS breakdown of the economyâs performance in the third quarter showed that growth was heavily dependent on consumer spending, which rose 0.9% on the quarter. Spending increased despite a 0.1% drop in real household incomes, with consumers running down their savings in order to make purchases.
City analysts said political uncertainty might start to weigh on the pound in the coming months. Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, said: âUK growth has lost steam in recent months, with the housing sector weakness now looking well entrenched. In 2015, the headwind of political uncertainty is likely to weigh on confidence, at least for the first half of the year.
âHowever, the lower oil price should also start benefiting UK consumers, and although the associated boost to growth is unlikely to be as significant as in the US, it will still lend a welcome support. At the same time, the lid is likely to stay on inflation, lifting pressure off the Bank of England to tighten for the time being.â
Stephen Lewis, chief economist at ADM Investor Services International, said: âSterling should remain stable as long as foreigners find the UK an attractive home for their capital, but the risks of a sharp fall in the pound would be considerable, given the extent of the current account deficit, if ever foreigners were to lose their appetite for UK investment.
âSuch an adverse turn of events might come about if UK economic or political fundamentals were to weaken. But it would not necessarily take developments specific to the UK to trigger trouble. Conditions of general risk-aversion, were they to arise, could also cut the flow of investment funds to the UK, as they did in 2008.â
Osborne also came under attack from his closest coalition ally, the chief secretary to the treasury, Danny Alexander. The senior Liberal Democrat said the Conservative spending plans would lead to the âwilful destructionâ of public services. He told the Independent that pledging to cut taxes after the election was playing âfast and looseâ with the economy and was not appropriate or right for the country.
