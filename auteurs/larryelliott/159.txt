The International Monetary Fund warned on Monday of the risk of On the day that Russiaâs central bank threw a $530m (£340m) lifeline to Moscowâs Trust Bank, the IMF said its generally upbeat assessment of the impact of falling oil prices on the global economy could be upset by investors taking fright at what is happening to Vladimir Putinâs energy-rich country.
Alexei Kudrin, Russiaâs former finance minister, said 2015 would be a tough year for the economy as he blamed the Kremlin for failing to act quickly enough and said the countryâs debt would be downgraded to âjunkâ status.
âToday, I can say that we have entered or are entering a real, full-fledged economic crisis. Next year, we will feel it clearly,â Kudrin said.
Predicting a wave of corporate failures and state bailouts of the banks, he added: âThe government has not been quick enough to address the situation â¦ I am yet to hear â¦ its clear assessment of the current situation.â
Olivier Blanchard, the fundâs chief economist, and Rabah Arezki, head of its commodities research team, said: âOil prices have plunged recently, affecting everyone: producers, exporters, governments, and consumers. Overall, we see this as a shot in the arm for the global economy. Bearing in mind that our simulations do not represent a forecast of the state of the global economy, we find a gain for world GDP between 0.3% and 0.7% in 2015, compared to a scenario without the drop in oil prices.â
But they said their optimistic analysis came with a warning. âOne of the lessons from the Great Financial Crisis is that large changes in prices and exchange rates, and the implied increased uncertainty about the position of some firms and some countries, can lead to increases in global risk aversion, with major implications for repricing of risk and for shifts in capital flows. This is all the more true when combined with other developments such as what is happening in Russia. One cannot completely dismiss this tail risk.â
Trust, which uses the Hollywood star Bruce Willis to advertise its credit cards, ran into trouble after its policy of offering attractive savings rates and consumer loans fell foul of Russiaâs economic slowdown.
The countryâs central bank said it was providing up to 30bn roubles to help the medium-sized bank in what is thought likely to be the first of a series of bailouts made necessary by the near-halving of the global price of oil and the sharp fall in the value of the rouble.
Russian MPs rushed through a bill last Friday authorising a 1tn-rouble recapitalisation of the countryâs banks, which have suffered big losses as a result of the currency crisis.
The central bankâs deposit insurance agency will be responsible for supervising Trust under a temporary arrangement until a new investor, likely to be one of Russiaâs leading banks, is chosen as a white knight.
Trustâs problems echo those of Northern Rock, the first bank to get into trouble in the UK when the global financial crisis broke in the summer of 2007. Like Northern Rock, the Russian bank had been offering loans on easy terms and paying annual rates of interest in excess of 20% on rouble deposits.
Its difficulties have been made worse by western sanctions, which have made it impossible for Russian banks to get funding from overseas financial markets, and left them dependent on domestic investors. The rouble ended the day 3.6% higher at 56.1 against the US dollar, although its gains were checked by a 2.25% drop in Brent crude to $60 a barrel.
The Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, told Middle East Economic Survey that Opec, the producersâ cartel, did not intend to cut output âwhatever the price isâ.
âWhether it goes down to $20 a barrel, $40, $50, $60, it is irrelevant,â he said.
Sberbank, Russiaâs biggest lender, was forced to deny a report that it had suspended taking new requests for car loans and mortgages.
Russiaâs biggest oil firm, Rosneft, eased worries that it could default as a result of sanctions when it said it had made a $7bn debt repayment from its cash reserves. But Rosneft announced separately that a deal to acquire an oil trading business from Morgan Stanley had been terminated after it was refused clearance by US regulators.
