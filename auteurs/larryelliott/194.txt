Stalled global trade talks were given fresh impetus on Thursday when After a four-month stand-off, New Delhi bowed to growing international pressure to rescue the World Trade Organisation from potential irrelevance when it agreed to drop opposition to an agreement designed to smooth the passage of goods across borders.
In return, the The India-US accord was greeted with relief by the WTOâs director general, Roberto Azevêdo, who was faced with the possibility that the collapse of talks begun 13 years ago in Doha would lead to countries giving up on his organisation and signing bilateral trade accords instead.
Azevêdo is hopeful the delayed deal on trade facilitation â agreed in Bali last December â will be the catalyst for concluding negotiations on manufactured goods, agriculture and services that have been going on since November 2001. The first multi-lateral trade breakthrough in two decades was put in jeopardy after the new Indian government of âThis breakthrough represents a significant step in efforts to get the Bali package and the multilateral trading system back on track. It will now be important to consult with all WTO members so that we can collectively resolve the current impasse as quickly as possible.
âImplementation of all aspects of the Bali package would be a major boost to the WTO, enhancing our ability to deliver beneficial outcomes to all our members.â
New Delhiâs hardline approach found it almost isolated at the WTO, with other members making it clear that they would, if necessary, sign a trade facilitation deal without India. Trade sources said the signing this week of a deal on trade in IT goods between the US and China has added to the pressure on the Modi government.
After a flurry of diplomatic activity in recent weeks, India will back the trade facilitation deal in exchange for negotiations starting in the New Year designed to come up with a food stockpiling programme that does not distort trade.
The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), which has said streamlining customs procedures could add $1 trillion and 21m jobs to the world economy, said the breakthrough would open the door to new trade talks.
