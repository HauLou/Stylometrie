Britainâs balance of payments has never been more deeply in the red. There have been some monster external deficits down the years but the one notched up in 2014 trumped them all.
Little is said in official circles about the nationâs current account. George Osborne talks about boosting exports and rebalancing the economy, but, the chancellor is not nearly as worried about the trade deficit as he is about the budget deficit. And not nearly as worried as he should be.

The trend is clear. The UK ran a current account deficit of 3.5% of national income in 2012. The next year it rose to 4.7% of gross domestic product. Last year, it hit 5.9% of GDP.
There are two reasons for this deterioration. Firstly, the UK runs a sizeable deficit on visible trade â manufactured goods, raw materials, oil and food. This is a chronic problem; there has not been a surplus on manufacturing since the early 1990s, while the days when Britain was a net oil exporter are over.
In the years leading up to the financial crisis, the profits generated by the City helped mask the size of the trade deficit. In essence, the UK was making more money on its investments abroad than foreign citizens were making on their investments in the UK, in part because UK investors were making riskier but more lucrative bets.
Since the crash, however, the position has switched. The deficit on investment income in 2014 was £45bn, bigger than the £35bn deficit on trade in goods and services combined.
In the past, news of a deficit this big would have alarmed foreign holders of sterling. They would have pulled their money out of the UK, prompting a fall in the value of the pound, which would have helped boost exports and trim imports, leading to an improvement in the balance of payments.
But seen from abroad, the UK looks a haven of stability. Growth was stronger in the first quarter at 0.4% than previously believed. Consumers are spending and businesses are investing.
But warning bells are clanging. Consumers are running down their savings to fund their spending. That will suck in imports. The pound is rising on the foreign exchanges. That will make imports cheaper. The current account deficit is set to get bigger. Sooner or later, the markets will notice and get alarmed. A good old-fashioned sterling crisis will follow.
