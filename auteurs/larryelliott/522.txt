As the independent member of the Bank of England's financial policy committee (FPC) no doubt discovered, there is no bubble in the West Midlands.
It's a different story in London, where Rightmove reported asking prices up 10% â or £50,000 â in a month. That smells like a bubble, and Taylor wanted to reassure his Wolverhampton audience that the FPC was on the case, monitoring whether borrowers could withstand higher interest rates.
This is all very well, but it is now time to flesh out warm words with some action.
Threadneedle Street has stress tested the UK high street banks to make sure they hold enough capital; it should now stress test its own model to see what would happen to arrears if a house price increase of 10% in each of the next two years was accompanied by, say, a three-point increase in interest rates. It would not be pretty.
