It's 1975. Harold Wilson is the prime minister and inflation has hit a postwar peak of 26% as you are about to join the Labour market aged 21. Move forward 20 years. It's 1995, John Major is the occupant of 10 Downing Street and it is the turn of your son or daughter to get a job for the first time. Who did better? If you imagined it was the one now thinking about retirement rather than the one in middle age you would be wrong. The 1995 entrant to the labour market beats the 1975 entrant hands down. Why is this? It is not caused by inflation, because the Between 1975 and 1995, the UK lost jobs in manufacturing and gained jobs in services, including financial services. Workers who joined banks or IT startups in the 1990s could earn higher wages more quickly than someone learning their trade in industry two decades earlier. Probably of more significance, though, is that someone joining the labour market in 1975 did so when the economy was stuck in its first recession since the second world war and had extremely high inflation. The cure for so-called stagflation was a three-year squeeze on real wages designed to bring inflation back down.
Workers then saw two more recessions in the early 1980s and early 1990s before the 1995 cohort entered the labour market at the start of what Sir Mervyn King dubbed "the nice decade". That's nice as in non-inflationary continual expansion â a period in which the economy grew steadily year after year. The peaks were not as high as they were during the ill-fated Lawson boom of the 1980s but there were no lows in a period of uninterrupted growth that lasted more than 60 quarters between 1992 and 2007. Clearly, this was a good time to be joining the labour market.
To be sure, things have looked less good for the 1995 generation since the economy went into recession in 2008. Their median hourly earnings fell by 10% from 2009 to 2013. But the downturn has had an even bigger impact on older workers, with the hourly earnings of the 1975 cohort dropping by 12% in the same period.
