Britain's annual Figures from the The ONS said falling sales in department stores and at petrol stations had offset a strong performance by clothing stores, where sales of winter lines were helped by colder weather.
The proportion of business done by retailers online rose by 1.4 percentage points to 11.9% â the highest on record.
Over the three months to November, a better guide to the underlying trend, retail sales volumes were unchanged on the previous three months.
In recent years, the pattern has been for consumers to delay Christmas shopping until December, awaiting bargain offers from shops and stores seeking to offload their stocks of goods.
But analysts believe the muted start to the traditional festive spending spree also reflects the squeeze on real incomes caused by prices rising more rapidly than earnings.
Howard Archer, UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "With purchasing power being limited by consumer price inflation running well above earnings growth for a prolonged period, it is likely that many people have felt the need to control their spending after spending at a rapid rate in the third quarter.
"With the CBI distributive sales survey indicating that retail sales gained appreciable momentum in the first half of December, this may yet turn out to be a reasonable Christmas overall for retailers despite the lacklustre November performance, but it is questionable at this stage.
"Consequently, many retailers may still feel compelled to engage in significant discounting and promotions over the final few days before Christmas to try and give a final lift to sales."
