The former head of the CBI, Lord Digby Jones, is to call for the creation of a business covenant with the government in an attempt to rebuild public trust shattered by the financial crisis, spiralling energy bills and corporate tax avoidance.
In a programme for Radio 4, Jones will examine whether the activities of banks, energy companies and multinational companies such as Google and Amazonhave fractured the relationship between business, government and public beyond repair.
Jones, who ran the UK's leading employers' organisation between 2000 and 2006, said a business covenant would outline business's obligations to society and what it could expect from the government in return.
Jones, currently chairman of Triumph Motorcycles, a corporate adviser for Jaguar Cars and JCB, and an adviser to Babcock International Group, said that in return for the government providing a skilled workforce, a modern transport infrastructure and a competitive tax regime, business should pay its taxes and make sure staff were looked after.
"Companies may have to make people redundant but if they do, they should make sure their people are retrained and make sure they get another job. They should take pride in paying tax and in being fair in their pricing policy."
The former CBI director general added: "The banks and the energy companies have done us no favours. The public still has a favourable view of small business but big business is down there with the journalists, the estate agents and the lawyers."
