Growth up and borrowing down. The savings banked rather than blown. We feel your pain.
Those were the three big messages George Osborne sought to get across as he delivered his fourth autumn statement on the economy.
The 50-minute speech marked a welcome break with the past for the chancellor. For the first time since 2010 he was able to say that the economy was doing better than forecast.
At the time of the budget in March, growth was expected to be 0.6% this year and 1.4% in 2014. The latest predictions from the independent Office for Stronger growth means lower borrowing: Â£73bn less over the next five years than previously planned.
It is not all good news. Britain is having a sugar rush recovery dominated by rising house prices and consumer spending. Business investment was supposed to rise this year but instead continues to fall. Net trade was supposed to boost growth but is subtracting from it. The recovery looks more unbalanced than ever.
Osborne's hope is that stronger growth will feed through into higher wages and rising living standards. The OBR's expectation is that earnings will grow by 2.6% next year while prices will go up by 2.3%. If that doesn't happen and business investment remains weak, growth will slow and the chancellor will be in political trouble.
In a way, the statement was a backhanded compliment to Ed Miliband. The Labour leader has been making the political weather by focusing on the rising cost of living. Osborne responded by cutting domestic energy bills and freezing fuel duties.
Osborne's package was designed to show that the government understood the pressures on families while at the same time keeping his powder dry for tax cuts closer to the election.
