The story of the first coalition government in Britain since the second world war is the story of austerity and thwarted deficit reduction plans. It is the story of a delayed economic recovery. It is the story of falling unemployment but dismal productivity. Above all, it is the story of a squeeze on living standards unprecedented in modern times. When the historians come to assess the past five years, they will single out the politician that really counted during this period. It will not be David Cameron.

Osborne has dominated the domestic agenda in the way that Gordon Brown did when he was Tony Blairâs chancellor, only without the toxic relationship and the feuding. Like Brown, the current second lord of the Treasury spreads his tentacles across Whitehall. Like Brown, Osborne is a highly political animal, forever calculating how to wrongfoot his opponents and with one eye permanently on the general election ahead. As with Gordon, friends of George can expect to be given a helping hand up Westminsterâs greasy pole.
There are two big differences, though. One is that Brown was a âbig beastâ before he became chancellor and Osborne wasnât. Indeed, in the runup to the 2010 general election, he was dismissed by political opponents as a boy doing a manâs job. Nobody underestimates the chancellor these days.
The second is that Cameron and Osborne get on. They chew things over daily. They donât keep secrets from each other. They donât brief against each other. Disappointingly for political hacks, there are no more episodes of the Downing Street soap opera that provided the backdrop to Blairâs 10-year premiership. Osborne would like to stay at the Treasury to finish the repair job on the public finances in the next parliament and would have strong support for a tilt at the leadership should Cameron decided to call it a day. 
First, though, thereâs the small matter of winning the election and thatâs where things get tricky. On Wednesday, when the chancellor of the exchequer delivers his sixth budget to the House of Commons there will be 50 days until polling day and the latest polls show the result as too close to call. 

Pre-election budgets rarely count for much. Sometimes the ruling party is coasting to victory and all the chancellor has to do is put some icing on the cake. Sometimes, the government is in such deep trouble that nothing the chancellor does makes any difference. 
This time itâs different. This time the budget matters, even though it is not going to be the budget Osborne might have envisaged delivering when he became chancellor almost five years ago. Back then, his aim was to sort out the public finances in one parliamentary term. But the economy has underperformed and deficit reduction is way off course. What was billed as a one-act play in 2010 has turned into a two-part drama. Austerity will resume after a short interval, although perhaps with a different cast.
There will, of course, be tax cuts in the budget. It would be naive â despite the chancellorâs âno giveaway, no gimmicksâ soundbite on the Andrew Marr show on Sunday â to expect otherwise. But the state of the public finances means his scope for generosity is considerably curtailed. 
Look for increases in the tax-free personal allowance or employee national insurance contributions, the well-trailed changes to the rules governing annuities, and extra help for house building and the NHS. An increase in the threshold before estates are liable for inheritance tax is one possible surprise.
But these relatively modest changes will not be able to disguise the fact that there is more pain to come, and plenty of it. 
The reason for that is simple: the economy has underperformed in the past five years and deficit reduction is way off course. Back in 2010, Osborne envisaged that by now he would have reduced government borrowing from more than £150bn to £37bn. The actual figure will be around £90bn. Progress, despite his claim that the governmentâs long-term economic plan is working, has been painfully slow. When adjusted to take account of how fast the economy is growing, Britain has a higher structural budget deficit than any country in the eurozone.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies, the acknowledged experts when it comes to the public finances, puts it this way: âThe coalition cannot go to the electorate saying âjob doneâ on the deficit. Rather, they have signed up to another very tough spending settlement for 2015-16 and the coalition governmentâs plans imply further cuts to spending in 2016-17 and 2017-18. The state of the public finances creates an obvious challenge for whoever forms the next government.â
Osborne is adamant that it is not job done and that the choice for the country now is âcompetence versus chaosâ.
Sure, he says, the deficit is higher than he expected it to be when he arrived at the Treasury in 2010. But thatâs down to two factors: his baleful inheritance from Labour and the impact of the debt crisis in the eurozone. But the economy is now on the mend. Britain is the fastest-growing country in the G7 group of leading industrialised nations. Inflation is low; 1.8m jobs have been created over the past five years; living standards are starting to rise.

This doesnât wash with his political opponents. Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, argues that Osborne overdosed the economy with austerity in his first two years at the Treasury and would do the same again if the The economy has certainly picked up momentum in the past two years. 
In part thatâs because Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said he would do whatever it takes to safeguard the future of the single currency. In part, it has been because falling inflation has eased the squeeze on real incomes. In part, it has been because the Bank of England found a way in the summer of 2012 of getting credit flowing back into the housing market. And in part it has been because Osborne abandoned his original deficit reduction plan. When it became clear that tax receipts were disappointingly low, the chancellor had a choice: raise tax and announce additional spending cuts in order to stick to his forecasts or accept that the repair job would take longer. He took the pragmatic approach.
 Prof John van Reenan, director of the Centre for Economic Performance at the LSE , said: âThe austerity programme of the coalition government knocked at least 1% per year off growth in the first two years of the 2010-15 parliament. In retrospect, the acceleration of austerity looks like a mistake and the slower pace of austerity in 2012-13 and thereafter was welcome.â
What is striking, according to Van Reenan, is just how badly the UK performed when Osborne was turning the screws in those first two years. 
âBetween 2010 and 2013, GDP per capita growth was worse than in the US and Japan, both of which had independent currencies like the UK. UK performance was similar to the countries in the euro zone hit by even more severe austerity and a currency crisis.â Per capita incomes in Britain, he adds, are no higher now than they were in 2006 and 16% below where they would have been had they continued on their pre-crisis trend.
Two other things are striking. One is that wage growth and productivity growth continue to be so weak. If the legacy of the Thatcher governments of the 1980s was ingrained long-term unemployment, the legacy of the coalition looks like being an ingrained culture of low pay, where employers expand production by taking on more cheap labour rather than by investing in new kit.
The other is that the Conservatives are doing as well as they are in the polls given that falling living standards have historically been the kiss of death for a party seeking re-election. Tory MPs can thank Osborne for this. If the election is about whether living standards have risen during this parliament they are in trouble. Likewise, if the central issue is whether Britainâs future is that of north-west Europeâs sweatshop. They are, though, still in with a shout if Osborne succeeds in making the election all about deficit reduction. He has learnt well from Brown: fight the election on ground of your own choosing.
