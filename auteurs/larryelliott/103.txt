And so it went on. With Osborne waxing lyrical about how Britain was again paying its way in the world, it took him half an hour before he started to run through any of his tax measures. The boasting from the Second Lord of the Treasury continued right to the end, with the claim that it was a âbudget for Britain, the comeback countryâ.
It wasnât, of course. It was a budget with both eyes firmly on the general election in 50 daysâ time, full of measures designed to boost support for the Conservative party in marginal seats and to wrong-foot Labour. The most egregious example of the pandering to votes was the help-to-buy Isa, under which a first-time buyers saving for a deposit on a home will get a 25% top-up from the Treasury. This looks suspiciously like a bung to better-off families and is economically daft to boot, since it will boost demand for property and drive up house prices.
This is not the first time the chancellor has seen fit to ramp up activity in the housing market. The joint 2012 Treasury/Bank of England initiative, Funding for Lending, was designed to get credit flowing back into the property market and did so with almost immediate effect. The original help-to-buy schemes were announced in the 2013 budget and provided subsidies for house buying. Osborne was so successful in reigniting the property market that, by the middle of last year, the Bank started to take action to rein lending in.
How does this square with Osborneâs argument that he has weaned the economy off debt and made growth more balanced and sustainable? The short answer is that it doesnât â which is why manufacturing and construction output are both below where they were at the start of the recession, and the Office for So while Osborneâs account of the past five years is that he took a bombed-out economy and turned it steadfastly into the worldbeater it is today, there is an alternative narrative.
It goes like this. Back in 2010, the chancellor inherited an economy that was starting to recover from deep recession. He proceeded to abort that recovery with a surfeit of austerity. The economy flatlined for the next two years, at which point Osborne quietly ditched his deficit reduction plans and decided to repair the public finances over one term rather than two. He knew the quickest way to get the economy moving again was by ramping up the housing market, and did what was necessary. The economy had a sugar rush which, judging by the recent weakness in mortgage demand, is now fading. Hence the need for another boost.
Even so, this has been the slowest recovery from a recession in living memory, slower even than in the years following the Great Depression. Growth in the years 2010 to 2014 has averaged 1.65%, compared to the 2.1% average when Labour was in power from 1997 to 2010. And that period includes 2008 and 2009, two years when national output fell by a cumulative 6% of gross domestic output.
Osborne has a number of things going for him. The first is that the sluggish growth of the past five years has been accompanied by strong employment growth and this has boosted consumer confidence. The second is that by getting the economy moving, albeit belatedly, he has got the political and economic cycles back into alignment. The third is that he is the beneficiary of the halving of the oil price, which reduces inflation, reduces government spending on welfare and debt interest payments, and gives consumers extra spending power.
But the biggest thing in Osborneâs favour is that plenty of voters still blame Labour for austerity. That has allowed the chancellor to develop a clear narrative, under which the priority is to run budget surpluses so that the national debt can be run down and a war chest built up in readiness for when the next financial crisis comes.
That narrative meant this could not be a pre-election giveaway. But a creative chancellor can always find ways of recycling money from one part of the tax system to another. The secret is to raise money from easy-to-hit targets and to distribute it to as many people as possible. As such, money raised from banks (the biggest losers from the budget), from tax avoiders and from rich pensioners will pay for help-to-buy Isas, a penny off a pint of beer, a freezing of petrol duty, lower duty on spirits, help for the North Sea oil industry and more generous income tax allowances.

But the generosity was still limited. It has to be when you are running a deficit of £90bn this year rather than the £37bn pencilled in five years ago. Under the current plans, the early years of the next parliament will see sharper cuts in public spending than have been seen thus far. Osborne is planning £13bn of departmental spending cuts and £12bn of welfare cuts, together with a fresh £5bn crackdown on tax avoidance. Ed Miliband said that if the Of course, the need for lots more austerity could be avoided if the economy grows more quickly and tax receipts exceed expectations. As things stand, this looks unlikely. Any boost to the economy from lower oil prices over the next year or so will be negated by renewed austerity and possible increases in interest rates from the Bank of England. Meanwhile, the UKâs woeful productivity record calls into question the picture painted by Osborne of an economy overflowing with high-skilled jobs.
As for the claim that living standards will be higher in 2015 than in 2010, this will be true on one measure by the yearâs end provided there is a 3.1% increase this year. As Frances OâGrady, TUC general secretary said: âThe chancellorâs Britain, where happy people skip to their secure jobs to celebrate their rising living standards, is not one that many will recognise.â
