Kristin Forbes, a former economic adviser to George Bush, is to break the all-male stranglehold on interest-rate setting in the UK when she becomes a member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee in July.
Forbes, 43, will be joined on the committe in August by Nemat (Minouche) Shafik, who has been appointed one of the Bank's three deputy governors.
Osborne said: "Monetary policy plays a critical role in our long-term economic plan, delivering economic security to hardworking people. Kristin Forbes is an economist of outstanding ability with real practical experience of policy making.
"She will make an exceptionally strong addition to the MPC. It's a sign of the high regard in which the Forbes, considered an expert on financial contagion, became the youngest ever member of the White House council of economic advisers in 2003. She has expressed concern that regulators are not being tough enough in their attempts to prevent another crisis.
The Treasury said there had been 34 applications for the MPC job after it was advertised last month, ten of which were from women. A three-person panel including Kate Barker, the last woman on the committee, conducted interviews and made recommendations to the chancellor.
Treasury sources said there had been an effort to find more women applicants. Dave Ramsden, the Treasury's chief economic adviser, sent out 80 emails to potential candidates, split evenly between men and women.
